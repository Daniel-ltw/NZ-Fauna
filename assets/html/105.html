<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Terns belong to the same family as gulls, but are distinguishable by a fork-like tail, which has led to their popular name of sea swallow. At breeding time their plumage changes and their cap becomes deep black. After breeding the black fades and the colours of the bill become less intense.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Six species of tern breed in New Zealand, while several others are regular or rare visitors. Four tropical or subtropical members of the family, called noddies, breed on the northern Kermadec Islands.</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Black-fronted terns</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The black-fronted tern or tarapirohe (<i>Sterna albostriata</i>) occurs only in New Zealand. It is the one tern that only breeds inland.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Black-fronted terns are small – 29 centimetres long and 80 grams in weight. They have white cheek bands, a red bill and white body with grey wings. Their forked tail is pale grey.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They breed from September to January, laying one to four dark eggs with brown blotches in a shallow scrape on shingle. Like all of New Zealand’s terns, both sexes incubate the eggs. The young fledge at 30 days.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Known as ploughboys or the ploughman’s friend, black-fronted terns feed on grubs and worms from freshly dug earth. At streams they eat mayflies, stoneflies and small fish. Once summer is over, the terns leave their nesting grounds for coastal and inshore areas from Stewart Island to the southern North Island, where they feed mainly on crustaceans in the plankton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Some black-fronted terns live along the braided rivers of the South Island, and like other birds there, are under threat from hydroelectric development, predators and rampant weeds, which smother nest sites. Around 60% of New Zealand’s 5,000-strong population lives in the upper Waitaki River basin, where in 1991 a recovery project was launched to halt the birds’ decline.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Caspian terns</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The Caspian tern or tarā nui (<i>Sterna caspia</i>) is the largest of the terns. They are about 51 centimetres long and weigh 700 grams. They have a white body and silver-grey wings. In the breeding season their black cap tapers to a fine point above an orange-pink bill. Caspian terns feed by plunging for surface-swimming fish; they also take whitebait, bullies and eels.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">These terns are found throughout the temperate world, except for South America. The New Zealand population was estimated at 1,000 breeding pairs in 1992.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The terns breed mainly around the coast, although some nest inland near Lake Rotorua and on river beds in Canterbury. Colonies are usually close to other terns or gulls. They breed from September to January and lay one to three light-flecked eggs in a shallow scrape on sand. Terns’ chief enemies are black-backed gulls, which eat the eggs and chicks. Chicks fledge at 33–38 days. Caspian terns live about 24 years.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Fairy terns</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The diminutive fairy tern or tara iti (<i>Sterna nereis</i>) is scarcely larger than a thumb tip when newly hatched, growing to a length of just 25 centimetres and a weight of 70 grams. They have a large white frontal patch with black around the eyes, a fine-tipped yellow-orange bill, and a white body with grey wings and tail. The subspecies <i>Sterna nereis davisae</i> is found only in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">They nest from November to January on sand and shell, laying one or two buff eggs with dark brown speckles. The young leave the nest at 23 days. Fairy terns feed on small fish, and can live to 11 years.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">In the early 1900s fairy terns were recorded around the entire North Island coast and on South Island river beds, but by the 1980s the number of breeding pairs had dropped to four. The population in 1999 was around 30 birds. In the 2000s it was New Zealand’s rarest breeding bird, and its survival remained in doubt.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Cats, rats and weasels eat fairy tern eggs, chicks and adults, and have been responsible for their decline. Storms, high tides, and people riding trail bikes and four-wheel drives also threaten the nests. The New Zealand Department of Conservation has monitored breeding and nests at Waipū, Mangawhai, and South Head, Kaipara Harbour. Their programme has included fencing off predators, relocating nests, educating the public and enforcing laws against the harming of wildlife. Even so, the 8–10 known pairs produce only a handful of fledglings most years, and in some years none at all.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>White-fronted terns</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The white-fronted tern or tara (<i>Sterna striata</i>) is the most common tern living along New Zealand coasts, and on the Chatham and Auckland islands. They have a narrow white band between their black cap and bill. Their body and sharply forked tail are white, and their wings are pale grey. They are 42 centimetres long and weigh about 160 grams.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A flock of white-fronted terns diving into the sea can be a sign that kahawai fish are close by. The birds feed on small fish, such as pilchards and smelt, which the kahawai chase to the surface.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">White-fronted terns bred only in New Zealand until 1979, when they also began breeding on islands in Bass Strait, between Tasmania and Australia. In autumn, large numbers of young terns and some adults fly to Australia, returning in spring for the breeding season. They nest from October to January in large colonies on beaches, shingle banks or rock stacks. They lay one or two spotted, pale green-blue to light brown eggs. The young fly at 29–35 days. They can live to 26 years.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The New Zealand population was reckoned at 12,000 to 15,000 pairs in 1997, much lower than a 1984 estimate. Detailed counts in Northland show that their numbers are dwindling. Threats include stoats, hedgehogs, rats, dogs and beach vehicles. A reduction of kahawai stocks may also be contributing to their decline.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Sooty terns</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The sooty tern (<i>Sterna fuscata</i>) is also called the wideawake tern because of its noisy call. They nest on the Kermadec Islands, and are rarely seen on the mainland. They differ in appearance from mainland terns in that their backs are brownish black. They have a large white triangular forehead patch, and white underparts and sides of the neck. They grow to 45 centimetres long and weigh 210 grams. Their primary foods are squid, small fish and crustaceans.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Sooty terns nest in a scrape on sand and lay one cream egg between October and December. The young fledge at 30 days old. They live for up to 33 years.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">With a population of around 25 million living in the world’s tropical latitudes, the sooty is the most abundant tern globally and in the New Zealand region. In 1990 it was estimated that the country was home to 22,000 breeding pairs.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Antarctic terns</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The Antarctic tern is the southernmost of the New Zealand terns. The subspecies <i>Sterna vittata bethunei</i> breed on islands between Stewart and Macquarie islands.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">These birds are 36 centimetres long and weigh 140 grams. They have a grey body and wings, a white rump and a white, sharply forked tail. During the breeding season their black cap extends down to the bill, which becomes bright red. They feed close to shore on small fish and crustaceans.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Breeding occurs between September and March. They nest in small colonies on the ground or on ledges, where they lay one or two buff-olive eggs. The young leave the nest at 27–32 days. They live to 14 years.</p>
<p class="p1">New Zealand has fewer than 1,000 breeding pairs. Their main predators are skuas and black-backed gulls, and on some islands rats, feral cats and weka also threaten eggs and chicks.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Arctic terns</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The Arctic tern (<i>Sterna paradisaea</i>) is smaller than its Antarctic cousins, measuring 34 centimetres and weighing 110 grams. Their plumage is similar, but Arctic terns are in non-breeding plumage when Antarctic terns are breeding.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As world travellers, Arctic terns have few rivals. After breeding in the Arctic they may fly as far as 17,500 kilometres to the Antarctic before returning. Since some birds live up to 12 years, they might travel the equivalent of the distance from the earth to the moon in their lifetime. They are rare visitors to New Zealand.</p>

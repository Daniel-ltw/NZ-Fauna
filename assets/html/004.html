<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Barracouta are carnivorous fish of tropical and temperate seas. They are slender and long (averaging half a metre), with a wicked set of teeth. Known to Māori as mangā, they were very important to the Ngāi Tahu tribe of southern New Zealand, who used lures to catch them. When split and dried they were a staple food.</p>
<p class="p1">During the 1980s and 1990s they formed a significant commercial fishery, with 20,000–30,000 tonnes caught annually.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Thyrsites atun</i>, the "snoek" or "Cape snoek", is a long, thin, perch-like commercial food fish belonging to the Gempylidae family. It is found in the seas of the Southern Hemisphere. It is also known in Australasia as barracouta though it is not related to the barracuda.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It can grow up to 200 centimetres (79 in) long and weigh as much as 6 kilograms (13 lb). It is found near continental shelves or around islands and feeds on crustaceans, cephalopods and small fish like anchovy and pilchard. This species will form schools near the bottom or midwater; sometimes even near the surface at night. It prefers sea water temperature between 13 °C (55 °F) and 18 °C (64 °F).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It is found off the coast of Namibia and the coast of the Western Cape and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa. It was originally called the "<i>zee snoek</i>" by Dutch colonists who arrived in the Cape in 1652. It is said to have reminded them of the freshwater pike (or <i>snoek</i>) they found at home in the Netherlands. The snoek is widely distributed in the colder waters in the Southern Hemisphere. It is found from Namibe in Angola to Mossel Bay in South Africa, off Tristan da Cunha in the mid southern Atlantic and off Western Australia, where it is call the <i>barracouta</i>, off Chile (where it is called the <i>sierra</i>). Bluish-black on top with a silver belly, the snoek grows to over a metre in length. It is voracious marauder.</p>

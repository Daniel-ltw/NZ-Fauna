<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">If you are a frequent visitor to or live in an alpine environment you will know the kea well. Raucous cries of "keeaa" often give away the presence of these highly social and inquisitive birds. However, their endearing and mischievous behaviour can cause conflict with people.</p>
<p class="p3">Kea (<i>Nestor notabilis</i>) are an endemic parrot of the South Island's high country. Although kea are seen in reasonable numbers throughout the South Island, the size of the wild population is unknown - but is estimated at between 1,000 and 5,000 birds</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The call of ‘ke-aa’ ringing through the air is deeply evocative of New Zealand’s Southern Alps. Kea (<i>Nestor notabilis</i>) are parrots that have adapted to life in the mountains. Their intelligent curiosity equips them well for the harsh conditions in which they live.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Māori would have encountered kea when crossing the Southern Alps in search of pounamu (greenstone), and named the bird after its call. To some tribes, kea were seen as kaitiaki (guardians). However, there is little mention of kea in Māori poetry and tradition, compared with their more widespread forest relatives, kākā (<i>Nestor meridionalis</i>).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Appearance</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As kea fly overhead, they show flashes of the bright red and orange under their wings. Seen from above, their colours are duller – probably to avoid attracting the attention of birds of prey.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The kea’s topside is mainly green with some brown, yellow and red, and blue-green on the outer wings. Juveniles have a yellow cere (fleshy pad above the bill) and eye-rings, both of which are grey in adults. Males weigh around 1 kilogram and females 800 grams. Like all parrots, they have two toes pointing forward and two back.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Distribution</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kea are endemic (unique to New Zealand), and are found only in or near the mountains of the South Island. Where these are close to the coast, kea may travel down to sea level. They live in high-altitude beech forest and open subalpine herbfields, up into snow country. Fossil remains of a kea found in a cave near Waitomo indicate they were in the North Island during the last (Ōtira) glaciation – at which time the South and North islands were joined.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Group activity</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kea often move about in groups – flocks of a dozen or more are not unusual. Adults and their young stay together for a year. Then young males tend to hang about in groups until they reach breeding age – three years or older.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Numbers of kea</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The overall size of the population is difficult to estimate. Kea tend to have a clumped distribution, rather than being evenly spread throughout their habitat. Their tendency to fly long distances in flocks makes them more difficult to count.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kea are more common in areas of human activity, scavenging for easy food near ski fields, mountain huts, hotels and rubbish dumps. This can give a false impression of substantial numbers. Estimates of the total population vary from 1,000 to 5,000. Scientists suspect their numbers are declining.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Breeding and life expectancy</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kea usually nest in cavities among large boulders, logs or tree roots, close to the upper limit of beech forest. The female lays up to four white eggs any time between July and January, and is fed by the male as she incubates them. Males are sometimes polygamous, bringing food to each of their mates at their respective nests.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In captivity some parrot species can live to 80 or older, but the oldest known age for a wild kea is 20 years.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Kea antics</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kea are either loved for their elaborate antics or disliked for the damage they can do. Pranks include sliding down hut roofs before dawn, knocking over a ski to ride downhill, or stealing metal objects such as nails – which the birds leave in a hiding place, sorted by size. They can solve complex intelligence tests.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Snow sports</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">One winter a group of kea at a Craigieburn Range ski hut came up with a new prank. A small gang of birds waited on the snow-covered roof over a doorway. They were alerted by a nearby sentry each time an unsuspecting occupant was about to exit the hut, and with precision timing would kick snow onto the person’s head, cackling raucously. By the following winter, the trick had spread to Arthur’s Pass, 30 kilometres away.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Kea-proof?</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kea investigate anything and everything with their immensely strong beaks, tongues, and hand-like claws. They work out how to open all sorts of containers, particularly rubbish bins, in search of titbits. In mountain huts and villages it is a challenge to devise a kea-proof container. Residents who leave doors open may return to find upholstery and mats shredded.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Climbers and trampers learn that unguarded tents, packs, boots and clothing are at risk. Rubber wiper-blades and door seals of cars are a source of playful delight to a kea. Unfortunately many of the synthetic materials they swallow do them more harm than good.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Wild foods</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Natural foods include nectar, flowers, fruits, seeds, roots, stems, leaves and buds of many plants from beech forests and alpine areas. A lot of these foods are low in energy, but grubs and other invertebrates provide a boost of fat and protein. Kea also feed on carrion and sometimes live prey. They would have eaten moa, flightless geese and other easy prey before these were exterminated by early Polynesian settlers (the ancestors of Māori). Kea numbers probably fell as a result.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Kea and sheep</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When runholders began farming sheep in the high country from the 1870s, there were rich pickings for kea. Due to a combination of poor farming practices and severe winters, there were many dead sheep to scavenge, as well as live animals trapped in snowdrifts. Kea were seen on the backs of live sheep, pecking fat from around the kidneys. This higher-energy diet meant that their population increased considerably.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Killing kea</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kea were blamed for low productivity on farms, although plagues of newly introduced wild rabbits and pigs were a major factor. A government wanting to be seen to act introduced a bounty on kea, providing an easy way to make money during the economic depression. Kea gained full legal protection in 1986 – but by then an estimated 150,000 had been shot. Some farmers would leave out poisoned sheepskins or other harmful materials such as fibreglass insulation to kill the birds.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Today farmers are encouraged to contact the Department of Conservation, who will take away individual birds identified as serial offenders.</p>

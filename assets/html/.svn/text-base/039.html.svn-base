<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">This mid-water predator (<i>Zeus faber</i>) can hardly be seen front-on because it is so thin. However, from the side the John dory looks quite large. Distracting its prey with an eye-shaped spot on its side, it scoops up the hapless creature in its large, protrusible mouth. The species is widespread north of Cook Strait and occupies a variety of habitats, from sandy sea floor through to reefs.</p>

<p class="p1">John Dory is an edible benthic coastal marine fish with a laterally compressed olive-yellow body which has a large dark spot, and long spines on the dorsal fin. The dark spot is used to flash an 'evil eye' if danger approaches the John Dory. Its large eyes at the front of the head provide it with bifocal vision and depth perception, which are important for predators. The John Dory’s eye spot on the side of its body also confuses prey, which are scooped up in its big mouth.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In New Zealand, Māori know it as <i>kuparu</i>, and on the East Coast of the North Island, they gave some to Captain James Cook on his first voyage to New Zealand in 1769. Several casks of them were pickled.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Various explanations are given of the origin of the name. It may be an arbitrary or jocular variation of dory (itself from the French <i>dorée</i>, gilded), or perhaps an allusion to John Dory, the hero of an old ballad. Others suggest that "John" derives from the French <i>jaune</i>, yellow. The novel <i>An Antarctic Mystery</i> by Jules Verne gives another account, which has some popularity but is probably fanciful: "The legendary etymology of this piscatorial designation is Janitore, the "door-keeper," in allusion to St. Peter, who brought a fish said to be of that species, to our Lord at His command." (St. Peter is said to be keeper of the gates of Heaven.) A related legend says that the dark spot on the fish's flank is St. Peter's thumbprint.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Morphology</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The John Dory grows to a maximum size of 65 cm (2 ft) and 3 kg (7 lb) in weight. It has 10 long spines on its dorsal fin and 4 spines on its anal fin. It has microscopic, sharp scales that run around the body. The fish is an olive green color with a silvery white belly and has a dark spot on its side. Its eyes are near the top of its head. It has a flat, round body shape and is a poor swimmer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Prey and predators</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The John Dory usually gets its food by stalking it then shooting out a tube in its mouth to capture its prey. The John Dory eats a variety of fish, especially schooling fish, such as sardines. Occasionally they eat squid and cuttlefish.</p>
<p class="p1">Their predators are sharks, like the dusky shark, and other large bony fish.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Habitat</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">John Dory are coastal fish, found on the coasts of Africa, South East Asia, New Zealand, Australia, the coasts of Japan, and on the coasts of Europe. They live near the seabed, living in depths from 5 meters (15 ft) to 360 meters (1200 ft). They are normally solitary.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Reproduction and lifespan</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After they are 3 or 4 years of age they are usually ready to reproduce. This happens around the end of winter. They are substrate scatterers, which means that they release sperm and eggs into the water to fertilize. Typical lifespan is about 12 years in the wild.</p>

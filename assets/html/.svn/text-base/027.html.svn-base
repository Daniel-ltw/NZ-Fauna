<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Most native freshwater fish species are called galaxiids (from the family name Galaxiidae). There are seven genera in the family and two (<span class="s1"><i>Galaxias</i> </span>and<span class="s1"> <i>Neochanna</i></span>) occur in New Zealand. The name refers to their profusion of small, silvery-gold spots, which were compared to the stars in a galaxy by those who first identified them.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In New Zealand there are at least 25 species in this family. New species are still being discovered, with eight recognised since the early 1990s. Galaxiids are a fascinatingly diverse group. Most are shy creatures that few people ever see. A small number of enthusiasts find them appealing and keep them in captivity.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Galaxiids have no scales, and their dorsal fin lies toward the rear of the body. The main fins form a propulsion unit towards the tail, making them adept at rapid acceleration and short bursts of speed, though not so well designed for long-distance swimming.</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Īnanga</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The most widespread and best known of the galaxiids is īnanga (<i>Galaxias maculatus</i>). Unlike most of its relatives, it is the one <i>Galaxias</i> species that lives in the open waters of pools. It swims in smallish, roving shoals, in pools and runs of lowland rivers and in wetlands.</p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1">In their juvenile form, īnanga are well known as the chief species in the whitebait fishery, which is made up of juvenile fish of five different <i>Galaxias</i>species. They are conspicuous to fishermen, especially towards the end of the whitebait season, because they have grown larger and developed pigmentation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They are robust, silvery-green fish, easily kept captive but rather subdued as aquarium specimens. They commonly grow to around 10 centimetres and are most abundant in rivers over summer.</p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Small fry</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1">Many New Zealanders consider whitebait a delicacy, with its sweet, tender flavour. Often lightly cooked in fritters, the tiny fish are eaten head and all. They fetch a high price in the netting season.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Life cycle</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">Most īnanga live for just one year. Large shoals of adults gather and migrate downstream at about the time of autumn tides, spawning when these higher tides flood the grasses that line estuary shores.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Once fertilised, the eggs settle down into the grass. When the tide recedes they are exposed to the humid atmosphere among the grasses, and develop there over the following weeks. Some hatch at the next set of high tides (around two weeks later). In cool weather, development may take longer, and they may not hatch until there have been two sets of high tides (around four weeks after being spawned).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Tiny larvae hatch when re-immersed in the rising tide. As the tide falls again, they are swept into estuaries and carried out to sea. There they spend winter, returning to fresh water in spring as the familiar whitebait.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Banded kōkopu</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Some other species of <i>Galaxias</i> are fairly well-known. The banded kōkopu (<i>G. fasciatus</i>) is another of the whitebait species, with adults commonly growing to around 20 centimetres. It is known as ‘native trout’ or ‘Māori trout’ – but it is no trout.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It is greyish-brown with vertical pale bands across its sides – providing camouflage in the dappled light on small bush streams. Banded kōkopu inhabit pools in the smallest streams, some of which are only half a metre wide with scarcely enough room for the bigger fish to turn round. When people live nearby, the fish can be quite tame, taking food from the surface of pools, and even jumping to take it from your hand.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Banded kōkopu as pets</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">They are beautiful fish, but successfully keeping them is difficult as they suffer from a fungus growth that develops if their body’s mucus layer is damaged. It is best to catch juveniles at the whitebait stage and rear them. To achieve this you have to know what a banded kōkopu whitebait looks like, and that is a skill in itself.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>More galaxiids</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Kōaro</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Another <i>Galaxias</i> species, kōaro (<i>G. brevipinnis</i>), is found in swift-flowing mountain streams. Many people know it as ‘mountain trout’, but it is not a trout.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The kōaro is a handsome fish, dark olive with paler markings, and if you see one out in open water on a fine day, the sunlight glistens along its sides. Some anglers know it as lake whitebait, although the species in lakes do not go to sea like those in rivers. It can grow up to 27 centimetres long.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Kōaro relatives</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There is a group of species that are closely related to the kōaro. Scientists are beginning to discover these highly secretive fish in the headwaters of streams in the eastern and southern South Island. Although very similar to the kōaro, they do not have larvae that go to sea.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Life cycle</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">They spawn in spring. Over spring and summer small shoals of whitebait-like juveniles appear in pools and backwaters. They live in open water for several months and grow to about 4 centimetres long, when they disappear into gravels of stream beds and are rarely seen.</p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Giant kōkopu</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The giant kōkopu (<i>G. argenteus</i>) is a large bulky fish that may grow to more than half a metre long and weigh nearly 3 kilograms – though it is very rarely that big. Notable for their silvery-gold markings, these fish prefer slow-moving waters and lakes, and do not move far inland from the coast.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In its juvenile form it is caught as whitebait, along with juveniles of four other native species. When it was first discovered that the adults belong to the same species as whitebait, there was widespread disbelief. It is possible that the common name cockabully originated as a European adaptation of ‘kōkopu’ or a variant such as kōkopuru.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Well hidden</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">West Coast explorer Charlie Douglas referred to the elusive giant kōkopu as ‘cock-a-bulla’:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">‘They haunt box drains like evil spirits. If they can get down a well they are happy and in some mysterious way they do get down wells, and if one could only get into a pool down a coal pit the fish would have reached the height of cock-a-bulla felicity.’</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Pencil galaxias</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The little-known group of small, thin galaxiids known as pencil galaxias live most of their lives in the gravels of stream beds. Most distinctive are the longjaw galaxias – two similar and closely related species with a protruding lower jaw. These little fish (up to 7.5 centimetres long) are superbly adapted for picking small aquatic insects from under stones in pools and shallows. Researchers are only now learning about their habits. It is possible that some of these fish may actually live deep in river gravels.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Fish out of water</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mudfish can survive a long drought. When their wetlands dry out in summer, they find cavities and objects to lie under, breathing air through their skin. As the autumn rains fill the wetlands, the fish are washed out again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Mudfish</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Also belonging to the galaxiid family are the <i>Neochanna</i>mudfishes. These are specialised for living in wetlands and swampy spring heads. Best described as cigar-shaped, some may be up to 15 centimetres long. Of five species, three have completely lost their pelvic fins (fins under the body about halfway back to the tail), and in the others these are much reduced. Using their dorsal and anal fins, and well-adapted broad, rounded tails, they swim among the debris of bush wetlands. They are known for their ability to aestivate – spend summer in a state of semi-torpor, surviving if water disappears.</p>

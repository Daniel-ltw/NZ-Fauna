<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">As they glide effortlessly through the water, sharks strike fear into humans. Yet the chances of being attacked are slim; in fact humans threaten these animals, particularly sharks, much more than the reverse, to such an extent that some species risk extinction. Sharks are not protected by law in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Of a world total of eight shark orders, New Zealand has six:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Hexanchiformes (frilled and cow sharks)</li>
  <li class="li1">Squaliformes (dogfish sharks)</li>
  <li class="li1">Heterodontiformes (bullhead sharks)</li>
  <li class="li1">Orectolobiformes (carpet sharks)</li>
  <li class="li1">Lamniformes (mackerel sharks)</li>
  <li class="li1">Carcharhiniformes (ground or requiem sharks).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Facts</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Kingdom</b>: <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Animalia<br>
<b>Phylum</b>: <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Chordata<br>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In 2004 there were 70 known species of sharks, 26 skates and rays, and 12 chimaeras or ghost sharks in New Zealand. The total of 108 compares with 95 recorded in the mid-1990s, and only 62 in the early 1980s. There are at least four undescribed species. New shark and ray species are continually being discovered, especially in very deep waters. Previously unknown species are found as fishing techniques become more sophisticated and research vessels range more widely and deeply.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Between 15 and 20 sharks and rays are endemic to New Zealand – they live nowhere else. It is difficult to determine an exact number because these creatures are very mobile. Most of the endemic species are rays or skates, which do not travel as far as sharks.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>An ancient family</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Sharks have existed for more than 400 million years, and rays for 200 million years. By 140 million years ago they had evolved into close equivalents of their present-day forms.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Some early sharks were relatively large. The three-million-year-old remains of the extinct giant shark <i>Carcharodon megalodon</i> were discovered by fossil expert Joseph McKee among cliffs in south Taranaki. Fossilised sharks are not common, as their cartilage does not endure in the same way as bones. McKee was lucky enough to find calcified vertebrae. Scientists have used them to estimate that the shark was between 4.5 and 6 metres long.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">More usually, a shark’s distinctive triangular teeth are the only fossil remains. A full set from <i>Carcharodon angustidens</i>, also extinct, was unearthed in North Otago in the late 1990s. It was an extremely rare find – usually only single teeth are discovered. Closely related to the living great white shark, this specimen may have measured up to 9 metres long.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Māori and sharks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Revered fish</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Polynesians, the ancestors of Māori, thought of sharks as guardian spirits. Many Hawaiian families had an aumakua, or shark protector.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In Māori mythology, the demi-god Māui placed the shark Te Māngōroa in the sky, forming the Milky Way. Sharks and rays, along with other animals living in the sea, were considered to be the children of the ugly god Punga.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Several Māori legends relate to sharks. In the far north, the ocean <i>taniwha</i> Ruamano took the form of a mako shark. If a waka (canoe) overturned, the crew called upon Ruamano to deliver them safely to land. In another legend, when the canoe captained by Tamatekapua was voyaging towards New Zealand, it met Te Parata, an ocean creature who almost swallowed the canoe and its crew. They were saved by a shark, and in its honour the crew renamed the canoe and their tribe Te Arawa (shark).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Māori likened their warriors to sharks, invoking them in battle cries such as: ‘Kia mate uruora tātou, kei mate-ā-tarakihi’ (let us die like white sharks, not tarakihi fish).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Shark hunting</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Sharks were an important part of the Māori diet. Fishing expeditions used to bring in thousands of sharks, which were dried on racks as long as 400 metres. The stench was tremendous – some European explorers remarked that fishing villages could be smelt up to 13 kilometres away.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Each year, the northern Te Rarawa tribe set aside two days for shark fishing. The first day was close to the full moon in January; the second was two weeks later. People catching sharks outside of these days were stripped of their property.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Small species, such as school sharks, were usually taken. Large numbers would swim into harbours at high tide, where they were intercepted and caught with hooks before they could escape. Observing one shark-fishing expedition in 1855, the European naturalist R. H. Matthews counted 1,000 people in a fleet of 50 canoes, catching about 7,000 sharks.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Jewellery, tools and cosmetics</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Māori used sharks’ teeth in necklaces or earrings. Particularly prized were the teeth of the mako and great white shark, which were valuable trading items. The teeth of broadnose sevengill sharks, or tuatini, were set in wooden handles and used as knives. Shark liver oil was mixed with red ochre to make the distinctive paint used on carvings. Blended with scented shrubs such as raukawa or manakura, the oil was rendered into a cosmetic for the body and hair.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Catching mako</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In order to catch the fierce mako shark, Māori would first catch a ray or skate to use as bait. Once a mako took the bait, a lasso was placed around its tail so as not to damage its precious teeth. The shark was then made to tow the canoe until it was exhausted.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Sharks as food</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>New Zealand’s shark fishery</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In New Zealand sharks are eaten in fish and chips – the fillets are in high demand because they are tasty and free of bones. Exports of shark products, which include fins, liver oil and cartilage, increased rapidly between 1988 and 1991, and since then have fluctuated from 3,000 to 6,000 tonnes per year. Korea, Australia and Japan buy most of New Zealand’s shark products, with smaller quantities going to France, the United Kingdom and the United States. Korea buys spiny dogfish, Australia school and rig sharks, and Japan chimaeras (ghost sharks).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Not all the sharks which are caught have been targeted by the fishing industry; sometimes they are by-catch from tuna fishing or bottom trawling.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Rig sharks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Found around New Zealand and Norfolk Island, the abundant and harmless rig shark (<i>Mustelus lenticulatus</i>) is 1.5 metres long, and grey or bronze with spots and a white underbelly. They take their food from the sea floor, no deeper than 860 metres, preying on crustaceans, especially crabs. Like many sharks, they do not lay eggs, but incubate them inside their body and give birth to developed young.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Rig sharks are the fish most often served up in fish and chips. They are caught mainly by set nets, and also by trawling. Reported landings peaked at 3,826 tonnes in 1983. In 2002–3 the annual catch limit was set at 2,034 tonnes, but recorded landings were only 1,449 tonnes. Casualties of rig fishing include Māui's and Hector's dolphins, which become trapped and drown in set nets.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Rig sharks are also known by the common names lemon fish, spotted dogfish and gummy sharks, and by the Māori names kapetā, mangō and pioke.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Spiny dogfish</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Probably the most abundant living shark, the spiny dogfish (<i>Squalus acanthias</i>) is a small species measuring just over 1 metre. The small spines on their dorsal fins can inflict a nasty wound. The fish are dark grey with white spots and a white underbelly. Spiny dogfish can live for at least 26 years in New Zealand, but populations in the Strait of Georgia, in Canada, can live up to 70 years. They hold the record for the longest gestation period of any animal – 24 months. Females mature at 10 years in New Zealand, and as late as 24 years elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Although extensively fished for fish and chips, spiny dogfish have nevertheless increased, replacing species such as hoki or barracouta in areas where these have been overfished. Fishermen reported landing 11,530 tonnes of spiny dogfish in 2001–2.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The name dogfish was coined by anglers who observed them chasing smaller fish in large packs, like dogs. The sharks are also known as spinebacks, and by the Māori names koinga, kāraerae, mako-huarau, mangō-<i>hapū</i> and mangō-pekepeke.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>School sharks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">School sharks (<i>Galeorhinus galeus</i>) grow to 1.7 metres in New Zealand, and 2 metres elsewhere. They have a life span of more than 50 years. They are grey on top and white underneath. Found worldwide in temperate waters, in New Zealand they are most common in the north. They inhabit both coastal waters and the open ocean, and are capable of swimming very long distances – 10% of all the tagged school sharks recaptured by scientists had swum 1,700 kilometres from New Zealand to southern Australia; one had travelled 4,940 kilometres.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the early 1940s school and other sharks were harvested for the vitamin A in their liver oil, until the production of synthetic vitamins began in the 1950s. High mercury levels were detected in large school sharks, leading Australia to ban New Zealand imports temporarily in 1972.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In 2002–3, 3,151 tonnes of school sharks were caught, down from a peak of 4,776 tonnes in 1984, just before the introduction of a quota system. Because they are slow-breeding, school sharks are vulnerable to overfishing.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As their name suggests, these sharks frequently swim in schools. They are also known as grey sharks, and by the Māori names makohuarau, tupere and kapetā.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Deep-sea and unusual sharks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Deep-sea sharks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A number of sharks live hundreds or even thousands of metres deep, and never come near the surface. Among these bizarre species is the rare goblin shark (<i>Mitsukurina owstoni</i>), which has an outlandish overhanging snout, and jaws which protrude when feeding, then retract. Another odd creature is the frill shark (<i>Chlamydoselachus anguineus</i>), an eel-like animal living down to 1,300 metres. It has around 300 three-pronged teeth.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Cookie-cutter sharks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The cookie-cutter shark (<i>Isistius brasiliensis</i>) is a small, luminescent animal with a glowing belly that attracts fish from below. They usually inhabit depths to 3,500 metres, although they have been seen at the surface at night, and are believed to make daily vertical migrations of up to 3,000 metres. Their name comes from the cookie-shaped wounds they leave on whales, dolphins, tuna and other fish. Forming a suction cup with their mouths, cookie-cutter sharks latch onto their prey and rotate, carving out a chunk of flesh.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Whale sharks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The world’s largest fish is the harmless whale shark (<i>Rhincodon typus</i>), reaching 12–15 metres in length. They can be recognised by their great size and distinctive blue-grey or red-brown colouring, with grid-like patterns of white spots and stripes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They swim in tropical and subtropical coastal waters and the open ocean, and some venture into New Zealand waters on their annual migrations during summer. Between 1980 and 2001, 36 whale sharks were reported between the Three Kings Islands and south to the Bay of Plenty. Following the East Auckland Current, which flows past the east coast of Northland south to East Cape, whale sharks feed on anchovies and other small fish. They swim slowly near the surface, occasionally opening their cavernous mouths to consume the prey in their path.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Basking sharks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The 10-metre-long basking shark (reremai, <i>Cetorhinus maximus</i>) is the second-largest fish in the world. Gentle giants, they can sometimes be seen from the coast swimming slowly near the surface of the ocean. Basking sharks open their mouths wide to catch plankton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Between 1986 and 1999, 203 basking sharks were accidentally caught in trawl nets off New Zealand; 93 were caught off the east coast of the South Island in the spring–summer period.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Basking sharks are found around the world in temperate and sub-polar seas, excluding the Indian Ocean. Although considered a coastal species, they have been caught at depths of 900 metres during winter, where they could be feeding on the vast bonanza of hoki eggs available at that time.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>A craze for monsters</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On 25 April 1977, Japanese fishermen 500 kilometres east of Christchurch hauled aboard a rotten and stinking carcass. After taking photos and keeping some of the decayed animal, they returned it to the depths. Speculation that it might have been a plesiosaur – a long-necked marine reptile known only from fossils – sparked monster fever in Japan. Stamps and toys were produced to commemorate the find. Finally, it was decided that the remains were those of a basking shark.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Dangerous sharks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Some sharks are dangerous to humans: great whites, bronze whalers and mako have attacked people off New Zealand shores. These and other dangerous sharks can be found in waters close to the coast or in the open ocean.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Warm-blooded sharks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Most sharks are cold blooded, so they live in warmer waters. But several species of the Lamniformes (mackerel shark) order, including the great white, mako and thresher sharks, have successfully invaded cool waters by developing special heat-exchange tissues in their circulatory systems, allowing them to retain the heat they generate from muscular and metabolic activity. This makes them capable of great bursts of speed. But in order to maintain their body heat they have to eat up to 10 times more than the cold-blooded sharks which live in the tropics.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Thresher sharks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The 4.6-metre thresher shark (<i>Alopias vulpinus</i>) has a tail fin with an extremely long upper lobe. The Māori name, mangō ripi (slashing shark), refers to the way these sharks, working in groups or pairs, use their tails to herd and prey, usually small schooling fish, but occasionally seabirds. The purple-brown and white thresher is found worldwide in warm, temperate and tropical seas, around continental shelves and in the open ocean. In New Zealand their stronghold is off Northland.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Great white sharks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The most feared of the world’s sharks, the 7-metre great white or white pointer (<i>Carcharodon carcharias</i>) is responsible for most of the unprovoked attacks by sharks on people, including a number of New Zealanders.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Great whites are dark grey to black, with a white underbelly. They can be found worldwide in cool, temperate and subtropical coastal and continental shelf waters. According to a 1999 study that compared great whites from Australasian and South African coastal regions, males ranged widely across ocean basins, while females remained in a particular region, perhaps returning to the site of their birth to have their young. Great whites live in the waters all around New Zealand, but are more populous around Otago because of the abundance of seals, on which they prey.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Great whites are also known in Māori as mangō <i>taniwha</i>, mangō ururoa and, to people of the Ngāi Tahu tribe, tupa.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Short-fin mako</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The Māori name mako has universal currency for this 4-metre-long shark. Indigo with a white belly, warm-blooded short-fin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>) range widely in tropical and temperate waters, from coastal waters through to open seas.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Short-fin mako are champion speedsters among sharks, and are prized by game fishers for their fighting qualities, earning them the name ‘blue dynamite’. Their teeth were valued by Māori, who daringly caught the sharks from canoes. Zane Grey, who wrote about big-game fish in the Bay of Islands, noted that mako could leap as high as 6 metres out of the water. When hooked on a line they have been known to attack boats, or land in them, causing considerable damage.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Blue sharks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Slim, graceful and bright or dark blue, the 3.8-metre blue shark (mangō pounamu, <i>Prionace glauca</i>) is among the swiftest of swimmers. They have been clocked at almost 40 kilometres per hour, making them second only to mako sharks in speed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Blue sharks can be found worldwide in the cooler depths of tropical seas and nearer the surface in continental shelf or open temperate waters. They eat mainly fish and squid. Although generally docile, they have been known to kill people. They are one of the most abundant oceanic sharks.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Hammerhead sharks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The distinctive skull of the hammerhead shark (<i>Sphyrna zygaena</i>) is believed to help detect prey, and to add lift like a hydrofoil, counteracting the downward push of the tail. Hammerheads are olive to dark grey, with a white underbelly, and grow to 4 metres. Large individuals can be dangerous to people.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Known in Māori as kakere or mangōpare, hammerheads are regular summer visitors to North Island waters, venturing as far south as Cook Strait. Juveniles as small as half a metre are sometimes seen in the Hauraki Gulf – it is possible that the species gives birth around New Zealand. They are found worldwide in temperate and tropical waters, from the coast to continental shelves.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bronze whalers</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The relatively uncommon bronze whaler (<i>Carcharhinus brachyurus</i>) can be seen close to shore in late spring and early summer, when they may be pupping. They inhabit temperate and tropical waters, both close to shore and in the open ocean. These 3-metre sharks have a reputation in Australia for unprovoked attacks on people, and in New Zealand there have been at least two attacks, both non-fatal. As their name indicates, they are bronze, and have a cream underbelly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Bronze whalers are also known in Māori as horopekapeka, matawhā, tōiki and ngerungeru.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Shark attacks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Shark attacks in New Zealand</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">New Zealand has a relatively high incidence of shark attacks. Record keepers differentiate between provoked and unprovoked attacks: sharks which have been speared or taken on a line will naturally defend themselves by attacking the person on the other end. Since 1852 there have been 44 recorded unprovoked attacks in New Zealand (compared with 39 in the whole of Europe since 1847). A third of New Zealand attacks occurred between Ōamaru and the Otago Peninsula, probably because sharks are attracted by the high numbers of seals, dolphins and pilot whales in that area.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Sharks to avoid</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Great white sharks have been responsible for most of the 11 fatal attacks in New Zealand where the shark has been identified. Other species known to have caused fatalities are mako and bronze whalers. More than half of the victims were swimming, a quarter were snorkelling, and the remaining quarter were either surfing or standing in shallow water.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">However, the chances of being killed by a shark in New Zealand are slight: since 1852 there has been one fatal attack every 13 years. You are far more likely to drown than be mauled by a shark.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Nets</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After a spate of attacks off Dunedin beaches in the 1960s, patrol boats and planes have been used to warn swimmers and surfers. From 1969, nets were also laid at local beaches; the programme was still in effect in 2004 at St Clair, St Kilda and Brighton beaches. In the early to mid-1970s, about six great whites were netted each year. Since then most of the sharks caught have been harmless.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Opinion is divided as to the efficacy of the nets. Gary Barton, who was rammed by a great white shark off St Clair in 1968, said in 2004 that he believed the nets were still useful. However, Mike Barker of the University of Otago Marine Science Department argues that netting is not in keeping with international practices, which aim to conserve sharks. He considers the nets too small to be effective – they merely provide swimmers with the illusion of safety. Even so, popular opinion is in favour of the nets, even at the cost of $28,000 a year.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Sharks under siege</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Increasingly sophisticated techniques since the late 20th century have led to the massive harvesting of sharks and rays. Previously invincible species such as mako and basking sharks are killed for their fins only; the remainder is thrown overboard. In parts of Asia, shark-fin soup is consumed as an aphrodisiac.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Conservation efforts</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A worldwide movement aims to stop such wasteful practices and conserve some of the vulnerable larger sharks. The 2000 World Conservation Union Red List categorises 19 species as vulnerable, 17 as endangered, and four as critically endangered. Four New Zealand sharks – the basking, spiny dogfish, whale and great white – are listed as vulnerable.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In Australia, South Africa and parts of the United States, the great white is a protected species. The grey nurse shark is also protected in Australia. Great white sharks have been fully protected in New Zealand since April 2007.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Curtailing shark fishing</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Formed in 1957, the New Zealand Big Game Fishing Council has 61 affiliated clubs with 33,000 anglers throughout the country. Many of these anglers catch sharks – the most sought after are mako because they fight fiercely and are good eating.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In recent years, however, there has been a change of approach. Rather than take sharks home, many anglers prefer to release them to fight another day. They will land a shark only if it could be of record-breaking size.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>A cure for cancer?</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Long believed to have health-giving properties, shark cartilage and liver oil are manufactured by several companies in New Zealand. There is a widespread belief that sharks do not get cancer or other diseases. However, no systematic research has been carried out to prove this.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In 2002, New Zealand researchers at Industrial Research Ltd and the Wellington School of Medicine tested the anti-cancer properties of shark muscle. Their studies showed that, when fed to rats with cancer, the extract prevented new blood vessels from forming. Because cancer spreads through the body through these vessels, shark muscle may help in the fight against cancer. However, the product does not actually stop cancers from forming; it may simply delay the progression of tumours.</p>

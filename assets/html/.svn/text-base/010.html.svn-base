<p class="p3">After galaxiids, bullies form the second largest native fish family, known as Eleotridae. They are often called cockabullies, but these are a different family of mostly marine fish. Seven species are widespread across the country. Small fish seen around a lake shore will probably be bullies, most likely the species known as common bullies.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Facts</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Kingdom</b>: <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Animalia<br>
<b>Phylum</b>: <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Chordata<br>
<b>Class</b>: <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Actinoptterygii</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Order</b>: <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Perciformes<br>
<b>Family</b>: <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Eleotridae</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Bullies are mostly small, with adults commonly around 10 centimetres long. They have scales and two dorsal fins. The redfin bully male has vivid red coloration, especially on the tail and dorsal and anal fins.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">These fish are found almost everywhere, although mostly at low elevations. This is partly because the young of four of the seven species spend their first few months at sea: the adults can be found only in places that are accessible from the sea.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">They have interesting breeding habits. The male establishes his territory, usually in a cavity beneath a large rock, and while guarding it, tends to turn a darker colour. The spawning female is lured into the territory and deposits the eggs, one by one, forming a single layer on the underside of a rock. The male, following along, fertilises them. He then guards them until they hatch.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bluegill Bully</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The bluefill bully usually grows to about 5 cm long. It has an ‘upturned’ mouth which it uses to pick its food (aquatic insects) from beneath rocks. This fish prefers swiftly flowing gravelly streams, just like the torrentfish.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Common Bully</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Even though they are well camouflaged against sand and rocks, common bully are often seen darting in the shallows during the day. The male guards the nest and when the eggs hatch, the larvae go to sea to return to freshwater after a few months. However some populations become landlocked and complete their life cycle without the sea phase.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Giant Bully</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This dark-coloured fish prefers lowland waterways especially estuaries and is almost always found beneath cover, only to emerge at night to feed. It can grow over 15 cm long. It is presumed that giant bullies have a marine phase in their life cycle, but this is not known for sure.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Redfin Bully</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Redfins are distinguished from other bullies by having diagonal cheek stripes and grow up to 12 cm long. Like other bully species, the male guards the nest before the larvae get washed out to sea, and migrate back to freshwater as small juveniles</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Other bullies</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The upland bully and cran’s bully are non-migratory bullies. They are difficult to tell apart in the field and both lack the head pores that other bullies have. They can grow to about 8 cm long and can be found in a variety of habitats.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Just to add to the confusion there are some marine fish that like to venture into freshwater from time to time. These include the black flounder which can be found a long way inland, the yelloweye and grey mullet which cannot live permanently in freshwater but penetrate large northern rivers, the stargazer which prefers salty water to fresh, the cockabully which is found in estuaries, the yellowbelly flounder which can be confused with the black flounder and the kahawai which despite being a marine fish can move several kilometres upstream</p>

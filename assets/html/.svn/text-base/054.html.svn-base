<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">New Zealand has 16 species of mosquito, known to Māori as waeroa. Twelve are endemic (unique to New Zealand) and four are introduced. They are about 5 millimetres long and, as with sandflies, only the female bites (the males feed on flower nectar). Some areas – especially around swamps – are notorious for their swarms. One site north of Haast, on the West Coast, is called Mosquito Hill.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In her book <i>Through South Westland</i> (1911), traveller Maud Moreland described a desperately uncomfortable night in the Blue River Hut. She and her companion slept little and in the morning their hands and faces were swollen. Today, tramping huts in such blighted areas often have insect mesh over any opening windows.</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Endemic species</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Very little is known about New Zealand’s mosquitoes, and much of the current knowledge is anecdotal and speculative. Most of the 12 native species of mosquito seem to primarily feed on birds, although some species bit humans, especially <i>Coquillettidia iracunda</i>.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The other biting species are <i>Culiseta tonnoiri</i> and <i>Aedes antipodeus</i>.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Vigilant mosquito</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">The most common native species is the vigilant mosquito (<i>Culex pervigilans</i>). It is commonly found around Auckland city, where it enters houses. A night-time feeder, its high-pitched buzzing and biting can disturb the sleep, although it rarely bites humans. The larvae are likely to be found in any container that collects rainwater, such as old tins or bottles. The larvae are known as ‘wrigglers’, as they often wriggle to the surface to breathe.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Distribution</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Culex pervigilans</i> is the most widespread species, which seems to be because the larvae occur in a wide range of habitats.</li>
  <li class="li1">•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Culex asteliae</i> occurs only in the northern North Island.</li>
  <li class="li1">•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The Rotorua mosquito (<i>Culex rotoruae</i>) is found only around Rotorua.</li>
  <li class="li1">•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Culiseta novaezealandiae</i> is found only in south-east Otago.</li>
  <li class="li1">•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Culiseta tonnoiri</i> occurs on the South Island’s West Coast and in the far north of the North Island.</li>
  <li class="li1">•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Aedes subalbirostris</i> is restricted to Otago’s east coast, Southland and Stewart Island.</li>
  <li class="li1">•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Aedes chathamicus</i> is endemic to the Chatham Islands.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The remaining five endemic species are reasonably widespread throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Introduced species</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There are four introduced mosquito species. Three of them regularly bite humans.</p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Striped mosquito</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">Named for the white bands on its legs, the silent striped mosquito (<i>Aedes notoscriptus</i>) was first noted in Auckland in 1916 and probably arrived from Australia. It is the mosquito most often seen in the North Island and females may bite during the day and at night. In the South Island the species is thought to occur only in Nelson, Marlborough and Christchurch.</p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Brown house mosquito</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">The brown house mosquito (<i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>) is native to warmer parts of the Americas. It is thought to have arrived via the water supplies of American whaling ships, probably in the 1830s. It is found around North Island ports and occurs as far south as Marlborough. It readily bites people, and lays its eggs in standing water around houses (for example, in guttering, bird baths and septic tanks).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Southern saltmarsh mosquito</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p class="p1">The southern saltmarsh mosquito (<i>Aedes camptorhynchus</i>) arrived around 1998. It was first found in swamp land near Napier, after complaints of its vicious biting. In its native Australia, this species can carry the Ross River virus and other diseases. Despite an eradication campaign, the insects have shown up in other parts of Hawke’s Bay, and in Gisborne, Northland and Marlborough. Eradication seems to have been successful in Napier, and similar schemes are in place in other areas.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Saltwater mosquito</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">The saltwater mosquito (<i>Aedes australis</i>) probably arrived at southern New Zealand ports on timber ships from Australia. It was first recorded in Stewart Island in 1961, and is also found in Southland, Otago and Westland. As this species does not stray far from coastal rock pools, it does not often bite people. Females do not need a meal of blood in order to lay eggs.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Slim pickings</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">New Zealand only has 13 sandfly and 12 mosquito species that are native. Similar-sized countries with temperate climates have more: Japan has 65 species of blackfly (sandfly), and 67 mosquito species; England has 32 species of mosquito. The reason may be New Zealand’s evolutionary history – there were no land mammals apart from a few bat species. In other lands, there were many large mammals for blood-sucking insects to feed on.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Dealing with bites</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Māori treatments</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Māori used crushed leaves of the ngaio tree (<i>Myoporum laetum</i>) to deter mosquitoes and sandflies. They also doused their bodies with oil, and with kōkōwai (red ochre) when working naked in the fields. To soothe itchy bites, they applied a juice made from crushed ngaio leaves or from fronds of rarauhe or bracken fern (<i>Pteridium esculentum</i>).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Preventing bites</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Sandflies</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">The simplest way to avoid bites is to cover up, especially when sitting or standing still – sandflies tend not to bite moving targets. They rarely bite indoors or after dark, and are not found above the bushline.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Mosquitoes</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">One of the best ways to reduce mosquito numbers around the house is to remove all standing water from clogged drains and elsewhere, as this is where they breed. When camping, cover up well, and avoid swampy areas. In mosquito-prone places, a fully enclosed tent with mesh screens is essential. Repellents should also be used.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Effective repellents</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">West Coast gold miners rubbed rancid bacon on their skin in the 1860s. When the minister for public works, Richard Seddon, rode the track from Paringa to Haast in 1892 he coated himself with camphorated lard, which he deemed a success. Also effective are home-made concoctions of olive oil mixed with disinfectants such as Jeyes Fluid or Dettol. Citronella oil, used in sprays and candles, or in skin lotions, can help keep insects at bay.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Insect repellents for the skin are effective against sandflies and mosquitoes. The active ingredients in many repellents are known by the abbreviations DEET (diethyl toluamide) and DIMP (dimethyl phthalate). DEET is the most effective repellent. It has been used by millions of people worldwide since 1957, and has a very good safety record. It is recommended that repellents used on children contain less than 10% DEET.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">All repellents need to be regularly reapplied. DEET-based products are typically effective for one to six hours.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Relief from bites</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Sandfly and mosquito saliva contains anticoagulants (to keep blood flowing) and agglutinins (to prepare blood for digestion). These cause allergic reactions such as itching, redness and swelling. Reactions vary, and compared to newcomers, local people seem to be less bothered by sandfly bites. As they have been bitten before, their bodies may not react as strongly to the proteins in sandfly saliva.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Sandfly and mosquito bites should not be rubbed or scratched, as this can inflame the bite and break the skin. Itching and swelling can be soothed by antihistamine cream or calamine lotion.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Diseases</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Although overseas species of blackfly can carry and transfer diseases, there are no records of New Zealand’s biting sandflies doing so. Nor have any mosquito-borne human diseases from a local source been recorded. Mosquitoes do transfer the Whataroa virus among birds on the West Coast, but this does not appear to kill or make birds ill.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Three introduced mosquitoes – the brown house mosquito, the saltwater mosquito and the striped mosquito – are able to transmit human and animal pathogens or parasites overseas. Four endemic species – <i>Culex pervigilans</i>, <i>Opifex fuscus</i>, <i>Culiseta tonnoiri</i>,<i>Aedes antipodeus</i> – may also carry and transmit diseases, but this is untested. Since the 1930s at least 30 species of exotic mosquito have been intercepted at New Zealand ports. Most of these can carry and transmit diseases.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Global warming will produce warmer temperatures throughout the country, and wetter conditions in its western regions. As temperatures increase, some mosquito species are likely to spread southwards, and there will be greater potential for exotic species to breed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Eat it to beat it?</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Many people believe you can repel sandflies or mosquitoes by swallowing garlic or vitamin B (for instance in the sandwich spread Vegemite), or drinking beer from a flagon to which a capful of kerosene has been added. But there is no evidence that anything taken orally works against these insects.</p>

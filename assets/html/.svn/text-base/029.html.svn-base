<p class="p1">General</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Geckos have baggy, velvety skin and broad heads. They eat insects, fruit and nectar and usually give birth to two young in late summer / early autumn.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There are at least 39 species of gecko in New Zealand. However, to date, only 18 of these have been formally described, and further discoveries of new species are still very likely as we learn more about them.</p>

<p class="p1">Gecko species belong to two genera: </p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Hoplodactylus</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">11 formally described species and an estimated 20 species still to be described</li>
  <li class="li1">Colour: Mostly grey or brown, with mottled, striped or banded patterns. However, the harlequin gecko, H. rakiurae, is often very brightly coloured.</li>
  <li class="li1">Habits: Mainly nocturnal (active at night) or crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk), although some species, such as the harlequin gecko, are also active during the day.  </li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Naultinus</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">7 formally described species and 1 yet to be described).</li>
  <li class="li1">Colour: Usually bright green, but sometimes bright yellow. However, the adult males of some South Island species are grey or brown.</li>
  <li class="li1">Habits: Diurnal (active during the day).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Did you know?</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Geckos are able to vocalise and many New Zealand species produce a chirping sound. Green geckos are quite loud for their size and produce a sound more like a ‘bark’</li>
  <li class="li1">Geckos have ‘sticky’ feet: their toes are covered with microscopic hairs that allow them to climb sheer surfaces and even walk upside down across the ceiling.</li>
  <li class="li1">Geckos are able to ‘drop’ (autotomise) their tails. This is a predator defence mechanism—the tail continues to thrash around whilst the gecko makes its escape; the tail then regrows over the next few years.</li>
  <li class="li1">Geckos are found throughout New Zealand on both main islands and most offshore islands. They inhabit a wide range of altitudes (from sea level to c. 2200 m) and a variety of habitat types (forest and scrub, tussock grasslands, rock outcrops and scree).</li>
  <li class="li1">In New Zealand, geckos are extremely slow breeding and long-lived: some geckos have been shown to live for at least 42 years in the wild.</li>
  <li class="li1">Duvaucel’s gecko (H. duvaucelii) is the largest living gecko in New Zealand, and one of the biggest geckos in the world, attaining sizes of up to160 mm snout-vent length and 120 g.</li>
  <li class="li1">New Zealand geckos are unusual in that they give birth to live young rather than laying eggs; the only other geckos that do this live in New Caledonia.</li>
  <li class="li1">New Zealand geckos are omnivores. They mainly eat insects, e.g. moths and flies. However, they also enjoy the berries of plants such as Coprosma spp. and the nectar of some flowers.</li>

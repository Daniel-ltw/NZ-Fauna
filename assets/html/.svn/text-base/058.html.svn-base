<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Octopus and squid represent the pinnacle of invertebrate evolution: they are the most intelligent, and contain some of the largest, heaviest and most aggressive of the invertebrates (animals without backbones).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Octopus and squid belong to a group of marine invertebrates known as cephalopods. Cephalopod means ‘head-footed’ – the arms and tentacles are derived from the head. Their closest relatives are snails, slugs, chitons and shellfish, collectively known as molluscs. Cephalopods have a long fossil history and include extinct groups such as the ammonites and belemnites, both of which have been found as fossils in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1"><b>Order</b>: <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Octopoda<br>
</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Of the five surviving orders (major groups), four are represented in New Zealand: cuttlefish, squid, octopus and vampire squid. The group to which pearly or chambered <i>Nautilus</i> belong are absent from New Zealand waters, although their empty shells occasionally arrive on northern beaches, swept down from the Pacific on ocean currents.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>How to tell a squid from an octopus</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A popular misconception is that squid have eight arms and two long tentacles, while octopus have eight arms and no tentacles. But this is not always the case. The only real difference between the two groups is that squid have hooked or saw-like suckers, and octopus do not.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Octopus and squid bodies</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">All species of octopus and squid have a mantle, head and eight arms (and in the case of some squid, two additional tentacles).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The mantle is a tapered or cylindrical sac containing the organs. Most squid and some primitive octopus have an internal shell within their mantle. A few cephalopod species (true nautilus and the female paper nautilus) secrete external shells. Squid and some octopus also have fins at or near the rear of their bodies, which assist with movement through the water.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The head contains the brain, two eyes, a mouth with a beak like a parrot’s and, attached to the underneath surface, a muscular funnel. When water is forced out of the funnel, the animal is propelled in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="p1">Both octopus and squid have eight arms encircling their mouths. Most octopus have suckers on the insides of their arms. Squid suckers are armed with a variety of hooks and claws. All squid possess two long tentacles at some stage of their life.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Techniques for disguise</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The bodies of octopus and squid are covered in chromatophores – tiny contracting and expanding pockets of pigment that cause instantaneous colour change. They have the ability to change from solid red to completely transparent in a millisecond. Octopus can alter the texture and colour of their skin to perfectly match the surrounding seabed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Ocean-dwelling squid and a few octopus species have light-producing (bioluminescent) organs that are used for counter-illumination, masking the animal’s silhouette against the bright light from above.</p>
<p class="p1">Most octopus and squid species can squirt out a cloud of ink from their mantle when disturbed. The ink is thought to function as a decoy to confuse predators. Some deep-sea species release luminescent ink.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>How octopus mate</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The third arm of many male octopus species is specially modified for transferring packets of sperm (spermatophores) to the female. During mating the male inserts his modified arm into the female’s mantle. Sperm packets are released through his funnel into a groove on his modified arm, from where they are guided to the female’s reproductive organs.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Some open-ocean octopus have a unique form of reproduction. This is true of the paper nautilus (these are not true nautilus, but a species of octopus named because their shell appears similar to that of a Nautiloid). The tiny male’s modified arm breaks off during mating, and through some unknown process navigates its way into the female mantle cavity, taking residence around her gills and eventually releasing its sperm. Males are assumed to die after mating. The blanket octopus (<i>Tremoctopus violaceus</i>), known from the Tasman Sea, exhibits the most extreme form of sexual size difference, with females being 40,000 times heavier than males.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Egg development</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Most octopus species deposit eggs directly onto the sea floor, but some open-ocean species brood their eggs in their mantle or around their mouth. The shell of the paper nautilus is really an egg case and brood chamber, secreted only by the female and in which she lays her eggs. Shallow-water species generally produce many small eggs that develop into hundreds, if not thousands of tiny plankton-feeding young. Deep-sea species produce fewer, larger eggs, and their young hatch and commence life as miniature adults, crawling around the sea floor.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The majority of squid and octopus hatch as miniature adults. Several exceptional squid species have a larval stage that undergoes a distinct metamorphosis to the adult form.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Growth</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Most octopus and squid species are thought to live for only a single year, and die after mating.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Octopus and squid are predatory animals with highly developed senses to help them detect food. They cannot eat their prey whole. Food enters a narrow oesophagus that passes directly through their doughnut-shaped brain.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>How octopus feed</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Octopus seek their prey using acute visual or tactile cues. They restrain an animal with their suckers, engulf it in an intertwined mass of arms, and draw it close to them. Most octopus and cuttlefish bite their prey and inject it with paralysing saliva. Before swallowing, they dismember the animal into bite-sized pieces with their sharp beaks.</p>
<p class="p1">The diet of bottom-dwelling octopus species is mainly molluscs (particularly whelks and clams), crustaceans (mostly crabs), and polychaete worms. Open-ocean octopus and squid eat mainly fish, prawns, and other cephalopods.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Predators</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Octopus and squid are the staple food, or are important in the diet of many fish, bird and mammal species. Most notably these include orange roughy fish, wandering albatrosses, and sperm and pygmy sperm whales.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Octopus in New Zealand</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Coastal species</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Of the 42 species of octopus known from New Zealand, only a few are commonly encountered. Octopus live mainly on the sea floor. However, small specimens of the common octopus (<i>Pinnoctopus cordiformis</i> or wheke) and the fist-sized <i>Octopus huttoni</i> can often be found in tidal rock pools. As wheke grow, they venture into subtidal reefs. Reaching over 1 metre in length and 9 kilograms in weight, they are among the largest predators on the reef. They feed on crayfish, crabs and shellfish.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Ocean dwellers</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Paper nautilus (<i>Argonauta nodosa</i> and <i>Argonauta argo</i>) are found in surface waters of the open seas around New Zealand. They are known for their delicate shell, formed by the female as a brood chamber for her eggs. In early summer, females move to coastal waters to release the shells containing their developing young. The empty shells are often washed up on New Zealand’s north-eastern beaches.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Giants</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Two of the world’s largest species of octopus have been found around New Zealand:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">An incomplete specimen of the giant gelatinous octopus (<i>Haliphron atlanticus</i>), which grows to 4 metres in length and weighs 70 kilograms, was trawled from a depth of 920 metres near the Chatham Islands.</li>
  <li class="li1">The giant South Pacific octopus (<i>Enteroctopus zealandicus</i>), which reaches 3 metres and weighs 30 kilograms, has been identified from beaks found in the gut of beached whales.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Māori and octopus</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">According to legend, the Polynesian navigator Kupe was led to New Zealand by the giant octopus Te Wheke-o-Muturangi. Intent on killing the octopus that was robbing his tribe of fish, Kupe, along with his family and some warriors, set out in a large canoe to hunt it down. The octopus swam south for weeks and eventually took shelter near Cook Strait, where Kupe found it. After a ferocious battle, Kupe tricked the octopus into wrapping its arms around some water containers, and killed it with a blow to the head.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Māori caught octopus by hand. They placed one hand into the water to act as bait and when an octopus wrapped its tentacles around their arm, they seized the body with their other hand and hauled the animal out of the water.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Octopus in proverb</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Māori refer to octopus in their proverbs. One draws upon the animal’s tenacious nature when hiding among rocks: ‘Etia me te wheke e pupuru ana’ (holding on like an octopus).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Another is scornful of the way octopus, if caught, give up without a fight: ‘Kia kaua e mate ā-wheke, me mate ururoa’ (do not die like the octopus, rather die fighting like the great white shark).</p>

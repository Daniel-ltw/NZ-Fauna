<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The tūī (<i>Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae</i>) has an exceptional vocal range, from harsh squawks, clicks and whirrs to bell-like melodies. Tūī mimic other birds and various sounds from their environment. Part of their range is beyond human hearing, so in the middle of a song they can seem to fall suddenly silent.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Māori sometimes trained tūī to talk, and some chiefs taught their caged birds complex speeches. To help them speak clearly, their brush-tipped tongues were trimmed.</p>

<p class="p1">Tūī are dark iridescent green with purple and azure highlights. They have two tufted white feathers under the chin, inspiring their other name, parson bird, as these look like a clergyman’s collar against their dark plumage. Lacy white feathers cover the back and sides of the neck. Males weigh 120 grams, females 90 grams, and they are 30 centimetres long. The Chatham Islands subspecies is bigger.</p>
<p class="p1">Tūī breed similarly to bellbirds.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Spreading pollen and seeds</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Tūī and bellbirds are important pollinators of plants, including kōwhai, pūriri, tree fuchsia, flax and kākā beak. They transfer pollen on their foreheads while collecting nectar from the deep throats of these flowers. Only tūī and bellbirds can twist open the flowers of two species of mistletoe.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They also spread the seeds of many plants – including tōtara, kahikatea, mataī, pittosporum and coprosma species, and other plants with fleshy fruit. The birds eat the berry, ‘clean’ the seed with stomach acid, and leave it at a new site with some fertiliser.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Feeding</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Adaptations for feeding on nectar include a curved bill and long, brush-tipped tongue. Nectar and fruit are seasonal, so the birds need other foods. In beech forest, honeydew – a sugary liquid excreted by scale insects living on beech trunks – provides bellbirds and tūī with carbohydrate all year. Both species also eat invertebrates, which can form up to 85% of bellbirds’ energy intake. Tūī sometimes jump and thrash around on plants to disturb large insects.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Both species travel long distances seeking food. In winter they move from small patches of bush into towns, where they feed on garden trees and shrubs that have diverse flowering and fruiting times.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Too many tūī?</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The tūī’s name has been used for the Tui Music Awards, and for brands of beer, balms, rental campervans and garden products. The first women to serve overseas in the Second World War were named the Tuis, carrying out canteen duties in New Zealand forces clubs in Egypt.</p>

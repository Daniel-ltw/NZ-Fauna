<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The trevally (<i>Pseudocaranax georgianus</i>), known to Māori as araara, is a plankton feeder, most common around the northern North Island where they move in close-packed feeding schools. Stragglers sometimes reach as far south as Banks Peninsula. In summer, they can be seen hunting down krill and other plankton, their backs breaking the water.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Trevally became an important commercial species in the 1960s and 1970s, when schools were targeted by spotter planes. Stocks became overfished, and declined by the 1980s. Recreational anglers make use of the narrow tail, which makes a good ‘handle’ as the fish struggles vigorously when brought aboard.</p>

<p class="p3">Known to Māori as araara, trevally (<i>Pseudocaranx georgianus</i>) are schooling fish, most abundant in the warmer waters off the northern North Island. Adult schools are often seen near headlands, pinnacles and islands where currents tend to concentrate plankton. At times, large schools of trevally break the surface, and they are commonly seen by big-game fishers and sailors in the Bay of Islands. Māori used to catch the fish on fine calm days by driving schools into weirs made of branches stretched across shallow, narrow bays.</p>

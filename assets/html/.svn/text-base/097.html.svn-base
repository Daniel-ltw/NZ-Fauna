<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The stitchbird/hihi (<i>Notiomystis cincta</i>) is one of New Zealand’s rarest birds.  A medium-sized forest species, hihi compete with tui and bellbirds for nectar, insects and small fruits.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was once thought to belong to the honeyeater family, but a recent genetic study suggests it is closer to the Callaeatidae (New Zealand wattlebirds). However, it feeds in a similar way to the honeyeaters.</p>

<p class="p1">The English name describes the bird’s short clicking call, which sounds like machine stitching. The Māori name, hihi, means rays of the sun or feelers. It refers to the male’s yellow breast plumage, or to the bird’s facial whiskers – which also earn the brown female the name mata-kiore (rat-face).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Stitchbirds are 18 centimetres long. The male weighs 40 grams and the female 30 grams.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Males and females have quite different plumage. The male has a black head, chest and back, with white ‘ear’ tufts that stand erect during displays. The black edge is bordered with rich yellow, and wings are contrasting yellow and black with a white wing-bar. The female is greenish brown with a white wing-bar. Stitchbirds usually hold their tails erect when perching. Their bills are short, and they have very long, brush-tipped tongues.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Feeding</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">Stitchbirds feed on nectar, berries and invertebrates.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Breeding</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">Stitchbirds nest in tree holes, which makes it difficult for them to escape from predators. They occasionally mate face to face – something not seen in any other bird. Some are monogamous, while others (male or female) have more than one mate. In monogamous pairs, males help feed the chicks. The oldest known stitchbird lived seven years.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Distribution</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">Stitchbirds were common around the North Island until the 1870s, but by 1885 were only found on Little Barrier Island. Since 1980, some have been moved to other islands and sanctuaries. This has sometimes been successful, but their food needs have not always been met, partly because of competition from tūī and bellbirds. Supplementary feeding with sugar water helps overcome this problem.</p>

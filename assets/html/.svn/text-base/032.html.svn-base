<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The grasshopper is an insect of the suborder Caelifera in the order Orthoptera. To distinguish it from bush crickets or katydids, it is sometimes referred to as the short-horned grasshopper. Species that change colour and behaviour at high population densities are called locusts.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Grasshoppers have antennae that are generally shorter than their body and also have pinchers or mandibles that cut and tear off food. Those species that make easily heard noises usually do so by rubbing the hind femurs against the forewings or abdomen (stridulation), or by snapping the wings in flight. They are easily confused with the other sub-order of Orthoptera, Ensifera (crickets), but are different in many aspects, such as the number of segments in their antennae and structure of the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympana and modes of sound production.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">Large, short-winged, flightless grasshoppers are extremely abundant in the tussock grasslands of the South Island, where their feeding can have a significant impact on herbaceous plants. New Zealand’s mole cricket or honi (<i>Triamescaptor aotea</i>) is the world’s only mole cricket without wings. Elsewhere, these burrowing insects rub their wings together to produce a loud mating call, but in New Zealand they are silent. It is not known how the voiceless species seeks a mate.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Large, flightless grasshoppers are common in the alpine zone. The highest-living alpine grasshopper, <i>Sigaus villosus,</i>is grey and covered with short hair, blending into its rocky habitat. It frequently jumps into tarns, where it floats, or onto snow patches, where its long hind legs work like ski poles to propel it to safety.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Grasshoppers galore</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A study of Cupola Basin, in Nelson Lakes National Park, showed that the mass of native grasshoppers above the treeline reached 32.5 kilograms per hectare. This was three times greater than the combined mass of introduced pests, deer and chamois. Even so, the grasshoppers did less damage to plants than the mammals.</p>

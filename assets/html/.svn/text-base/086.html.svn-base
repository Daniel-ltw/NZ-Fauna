<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">New Zealand has two fish of the Retropinnidae family. These are the common smelt (<i>Retropinna retropinna</i>) and Stokell’s smelt (<i>Stokellia anisodon</i>). Although smelt have a very strong cucumber odour when they are first captured, the name smelt has nothing to do with this. It is an ancient word for silvery – referring to their colour.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Growing to around 10 centimetres, smelt move into lowland rivers from the sea as mature adults to spawn – often being caught towards the end of the whitebait fishing season, in spring. They are very fragile, dying within a minute or two if handled.</p>
<p class="p1">The smelt populations in some inland lakes, especially in the central North Island, belong to the same species, but have abandoned migrations to and from the sea, spending their whole lives in fresh water.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Common Smelt</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There are two New Zealand species in the Retropinnidae family, the common smelt and Stokells smelt. This family of fishes, known as the southern smelts, is also found in Australia, but the two species we have here are unique to this country. Smelt can be distinguished from other species by their easily dislodged scales, and by the presence of the adipose fin, a small fleshy lobe on their back between the dorsal fin and the tail. They also have a distinctly forked tail and a peculiar, strong cucumber smell. The two species that live in New Zealand are very difficult to tell apart, and positive identification depends primarily on the size and number of the scales.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Smelt are a pelagic species, which means they swim in mid water rather than resting or hiding on the substrate. Thus, they are often seen out in the open in streams and lakes as they feed on drifting food organisms. The common smelt is widespread throughout New Zealand, including Stewart and Chatham Island. They live in flowing and still water, and there are both diadromous (sea-going) and non-diadromous (land-locked) populations, although humans have established many of the latter. Although they are not a climbing species, smelt are good swimmers and will penetrate well inland in river systems that are not too steep, e.g. the Wanganui or Manawatu River. They are particularly abundant in the Waikato River catchment.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Of the freshwater fish that live in New Zealand, smelt are one of the most sensitive to pollutants like high water temperature or ammonia. In some cases, they are as intolerant as the salmonids, which are often used as a benchmark species overseas for establishing water quality guidelines to ensure fish are protected from human activities. Smelt are therefore an appropriate native species for establishing guidelines for New Zealand waterways and usually their presence indicates that the water quality is suitable for most other fish.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Stokell’s Smelt</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Stokells smelt is the second of the two smelt species found in New Zealand. Although it superficially resembles the common smelt, it is sufficiently different, at least to biologists, to warrant a new generic name, Stokellia. This name honours G. Stokell, a biologist who collected and studied New Zealand’s freshwater fish for over 40 years, and who did much to identify and classify the species.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Stokells smelt has smaller and more scales than the common smelt, a feature that only an expert would recognise. The teeth, again not a very obvious feature, are also used to tell the two species apart. The small, fleshy, adipose fin can be used to distinguish smelt from the galaxiids, however, and smelt can be distinguished from the salmonids because they do not have a lateral line.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Found only on the east coast of the South Island between the Waiau and Waitaki Rivers, Stokells smelt is a strictly coastal species and is never found very far inland. In fact, this species probably spends most of its life in the marine environment. They enter fresh water to spawn in late spring and summer, and can be extremely abundant at times, providing a feast for the trout, kahawai, and sea birds that prey on the annual migrations. Stokells smelt grows to about 95 mm in length, but mature adults are typically 70–90 mm long.</p>

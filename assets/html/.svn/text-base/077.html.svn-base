<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Sea anemones make up most of the 106 soft hexacoral species in New Zealand waters. Children exploring rock pools may enjoy prodding anemone stomach cavities to feel the gentle tug of the nettle cells – the poisons are too weak to be felt as a sting. Anemones can live singly or in chains. Most are permanently submerged, but some survive above low tide for a few hours in damp shade. The wandering sea anemone (<i>Phlyctenactis tuberculosa</i>) only loosely attaches itself, and is generally found floating among seaweed. The colourful jewel anemone (<i>Corynactis australis</i>) has tentacles with terminal knobs, each studded with nettle cells.</p>

<p class="p1">Sea anemones are a group of the Coelenterata which appear as blobs of jelly-like substance on rocks beneath the water. They depend on food swept towards them by currents of water. Each animal has a simple body cavity, with one opening which serves for taking in food and ejecting waste products.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The mouth of a sea anemone is a fleshy opening in the centre of a circle of tentacles and it leads into the stomach, which usually occupies about a third of the bulk of the body. Below the stomach there are a number of radiately arranged cavities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Anemones, despite their harmless flower-like appearance, are voracious animals. They use the tentacles to ensnare and sting their victims preparatory to swallowing them whole. Indigestible parts are later disgorged. The food of anemones consists of any small fishes, shrimps, and shellfish which come within range of the tentacles.</p>
<p class="p1">The red sea anemone (<i>Actinia tenebrosa</i>) is our most abundant and widely distributed sea anemone, easily recognised by its deep red colour. There are many other New Zealand species but their identification is difficult.</p>

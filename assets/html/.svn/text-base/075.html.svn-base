<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The North Island saddleback (<i>Philesturnus rufusater</i>) and South Island saddleback (<i>Philesturnus carunculatus</i>) are both known as tīeke to Māori. They belong to an old endemic family, Callaeatidae (New Zealand wattlebirds).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Both species are glossy black with a chestnut-red saddle and rump, and red fleshy wattles hanging from the base of the bill. The North Island saddleback has a buff-coloured line at the edge of the saddle. They run on long, strong legs, and fly noisily for short distances. Their call is an insistent, raucous ‘tee-kekeke’.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Decline and partial recovery</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Saddlebacks were very common when European settlement began. But as rats, stoats and ferrets spread they declined rapidly, until they were left on only a few rat-free islands. They roost and nest in holes, often near the ground, so are easily caught. The removal of predators from islands and fenced mainland sanctuaries has allowed several new populations of South and North Island saddlebacks to become established. Where food is plentiful, they raise several broods a year.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Feeding</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Saddlebacks eat insects, fruit and nectar. Their specially adapted jaw allows them to open their bill forcefully, and prise open decaying wood looking for grubs, wētā and other large invertebrates. Like parrots, they sometimes hold food with one foot and tear it apart with their bill.</p>

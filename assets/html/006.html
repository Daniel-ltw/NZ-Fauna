<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Bees belong to the order Hymenoptera – one of the largest insect groups, which includes ants and wasps. Like wasps, bees may be solitary or social. They feed on nectar and pollen, and play an important role in the pollination and survival of many flowering plants. New Zealand has 28 native and 13 introduced species of bee.</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>The narrow-waisted Hymenoptera</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Bees belong to the order Hymenoptera – one of the largest insect groups, which includes ants and wasps. Hymenoptera adults nearly all have a narrow waist, between the thorax and abdomen. They have two pairs of membranous wings, the front pair larger. Some are wingless.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Many species form colonies and have a social structure with specialised roles, but others live alone. In some species the female’s ovipositor (egg-laying tube) doubles as a stinger. Males do not sting.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Differences between wasps and bees</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Wasps and bees are similar in most respects – bees are really a sub-group of wasps. Wasps have few or no hairs. Most wasp larvae feed on invertebrates, and adults mainly on sugary food such as nectar.</p>
<p class="p1">Bees have hairy bodies. They are totally vegetarian, and mostly feed their larvae on pollen.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Life cycle</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The Hymenoptera life cycle has four stages:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">The adult female lays eggs.</li>
  <li class="li1">A larva (without legs) hatches, eats and grows.</li>
  <li class="li1">It forms a pupa.</li>
  <li class="li1">The adult eventually emerges.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Thousands of native species</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">New Zealand has an estimated 2,000–3,000 species of wasp and bee, most of which are native. The exact number is not known, as new species are still being found. Most are not very noticeable, and many are tiny. Groups include wood wasps and sawflies, parasitic wasps, stinging wasps, hunting wasps and bees.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Conspicuous introduced species</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">More easily seen are the introduced German and common wasps, paper wasps, honeybees and bumblebees. They form a tiny fraction of the total number of species, but they cross our paths more often.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Native bees</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">At least three native bee species have a basic social structure, a bit like the introduced honeybee and bumblebee. The rest are solitary, although they may make nests close together.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Native bees pollinate many native plants. They are also widespread in kiwifruit and apple orchards and some vegetable crops, and may be important pollinators in horticulture.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Leioproctus bees</b></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The most commonly seen native bees are 18 species of <i>Leioproctus</i>. These bees are robust and hairy, looking similar to honeybees but smaller (5–12 millimetres long). All are black except for the South Island species <i>Leioproctus fulvescens</i>, which is covered with dense orange–yellow hair. They are often seen in summer carrying pollen on their back legs, like honeybees and bumblebees.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">They dig nest holes in the ground, and sometimes a nesting area riddled with bee holes gives the impression of a colony. A small pile of soil is the usual sign of individual nest tunnels. Each species prefers a specific type of soil. For example,<i>Leioproctus fulvescens</i> needs fine-grained soil, while<i>Leioproctus metallicus</i> nests in coastal sand.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Hylaeus bees</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The seven <i>Hylaeus</i> species are 7–9 millimetres long, and slender. Almost hairless, they are black with small yellow markings on the face and thorax. They make nests in blind tunnels in twigs and branches, or in old beetle holes in logs. They have no special pollen-carrying structure on the back legs, so carry pollen in the stomach.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Lasioglossum bees</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The smallest (4–8 millimetres long) and most easily overlooked native bees are four species of <i>Lasioglossum</i>. They are black or greenish, only moderately hairy, and nest in the soil. At least one species, <i>Lasioglossum sordidum</i>, has adapted well to modified habitats. Its nests are often found along fencelines, on horticultural land sprayed bare with herbicides, and on stopbanks and ditch sides above water level.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Introduced bees</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Honeybees</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Honeybees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) are the familiar golden-orange and brown species, brought to New Zealand from England by settlers for honey production and plant pollination. The first documented introduction was to the Hokianga, Northland, in 1839.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Pollination and bee products</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Honeybees visit more flowering plant species, including many native plants, than any other bee. They are of huge economic importance, vital for the pollination of many fruit, vegetable and seed crops, and they produce honey, beeswax, pollen, royal jelly and propolis. New Zealand’s 300,000 commercial hives produced 9,000 tonnes of honey a year on average between 2001 and 2005.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Honeybee colonies</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Honeybees have a social structure within the colony or hive. Each colony has one egg-laying queen (15–20 millimetres long), a variable number of drones – all males – and many thousands of sterile female workers (11–15 millimetres long).</p>
<p class="p1">Workers build a regular honeycomb structure of hexagonal cells where food – nectar and pollen – is stored and larvae develop. They also gather nectar, pollen and sap, manage honey production, and feed the larvae, queen and drones.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A breakaway group of bees with a queen may swarm and form a new, feral colony. These tend to be in hollow places – tree or rock cavities, and hollow walls or ceilings of buildings.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A beekeeper’s artificial hive mimics a wild hive, but is designed to simplify the management of the bees and their honey.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Varroa mite parasite</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Accidental introduction of the damaging parasite of the varroa mite (<i>Varroa destructor</i>) to the North Island has affected the honey industry there since 2000, and is responsible for the almost total elimination of feral honeybee colonies there. By 2006 it had spread to the South Island.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bumblebees</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Four species of bumblebee (<i>Bombus</i>) were introduced from England in 1885 and 1906 for pollination and seed production of red clover. Their longer tongues can reach inside red clover flowers, which the shorter-tongued honeybees cannot do – although they are excellent pollinators of the smaller white clover flowers. Bumblebees are sometimes used to pollinate greenhouse and orchard crops.</p>
<p class="p1">Only females (queens and workers) have a sting, but they are not aggressive and usually sting only if disturbed or handled roughly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bumblebee colonies</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Bumblebees have a social structure, and they build nests in dry cavities – abandoned rodent nests, rabbit burrows, wood piles, compost heaps, old stuffed chairs and sofas, under houses or in walls.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The nest cells are oval or almost spherical, made in irregular horizontal layers rather than the neat combs of the honeybee. Colonies are also smaller – by January to February (summertime), there are about 200 workers in a mature colony of the large earth bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Nests run down in late summer and are often destroyed by invading rodents, insects, mites and slaters. The foundress queen dies, but new queens leave the old nest and overwinter in small cavities they excavate in the soil</p>

<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Most of the familiar edible shellfish such as mussels, cockles, oysters, pipi and scallops belong to a group of molluscs known as bivalves. The term bivalve refers to their two hinged shells (technically valves). Both shells are usually of the same shape, as in mussels, but in oysters and scallops one is flat and one curved.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Bivalves are adapted to living in a confined space and feeding by straining plankton from the water. Even though they have no head or radula (rasping tongue), bivalves are a successful group, with 436 species known from around New Zealand. They are also prolific. Some species can reach phenomenal densities: over 20,000 per square metre.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Most bivalves are sedentary or slow-moving animals. Some, such as pipi and cockles, spend their life buried in seafloor sediment, while others like the oyster and mussel remain anchored to one spot.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Sediment burrowers</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Bivalve shellfish are adapted for burrowing into ocean sediments, pulling themselves down with their foot. Different species live at different depths beneath the sea floor. Burrowing bivalves extend a pair of siphons which act as their feeding, breathing, and waste-removal tubes. Water is drawn in through one siphon and passes over the shellfish’s gills, where food particles are strained off and oxygen is absorbed. The water is then expelled through the other siphon.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bridge over troubled waters</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Shipworms, the scourge of wooden sailing ships for centuries, still wreak havoc today. They caused the collapse of a rail bridge spanning the Nūhaka River, on the East Coast, in 2005. Supporting timbers below the high-water level were riddled with the burrowing shellfish.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Rock and wood borers</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A few species – angel wing (<i>Barnea similis</i>), date mussel (<i>Zelithophaga truncata</i>) and piddocks (<i>Pholadidea suteri</i> and <i>P. tridens</i>) – bore into soft coastal rocks to form their burrows. Like the sediment burrowers, they filter feed by means of long siphons.</p>
<p class="p1">The peculiar shipworm (<i>Bankia</i> species) tunnels into submerged wood. With a greatly reduced shell at the front of their worm-like body, shipworms are barely recognisable as bivalve shellfish.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Mussels</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mussels attach themselves to rocks and solid structures with strong, elastic threads secreted from a gland in their foot. When young, mussels can separate from their threads and move about a little. New Zealand has 22 species of true mussel, of which the commercially farmed green shell mussel (<i>Perna canaliculus</i>) is the best known. Along with the blue mussel (<i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i>), it is common around rocky coasts from low tide to subtidal depths.</p>

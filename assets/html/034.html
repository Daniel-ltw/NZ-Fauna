<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Gulls, terns and skuas belong to the order <i>Charadriiformes</i>, which includes both sea and shorebirds. They have webbed feet and are partly dependent on marine or freshwater food sources. In New Zealand all of these birds are protected, except black-backed gulls. Brown skuas are partially protected.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Gulls and terns are gregarious birds common to New Zealand’s inland and coastal regions.</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Black-backed gulls</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Black-backed gulls or karoro (<i>Larus dominicanus</i>) can be found in the southern hemisphere from Antarctica to the subtropics. Elsewhere they are known as Dominican or kelp gulls. The subspecies in New Zealand is the widespread <i>Larus dominicanus dominicanus</i>. There are probably over two million in coastal and near-shore environments, and inland waterways. They do not generally venture far out to sea.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Of New Zealand’s gull species, black-blacked gulls are the largest, at 60 centimetres long. Males weigh over 1 kilogram, and females about 850 grams. Adults have white bodies, black wings, and yellow bills and legs.</p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Predators</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The gulls threaten rare birds such as the New Zealand dotterel, little blue penguin, and some terns and petrels by predating on eggs and chicks. They can also attack newborn lambs. They were found to spread <i>Salmonella brandenburg</i>, an infection causing spontaneous abortions in sheep and cattle, which the gulls got by eating dead foetuses with the disease.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Black-backed gulls also feed on fish, shellfish, offal and carcasses, and fruit. They are often seen in ploughed fields taking worms and grubs. The gulls often return to favourite feeding spots.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Training and taming</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Black-backed gulls’ predatory nature has been put to good use. Māori trained them to eat the caterpillars that infested kūmara (sweet potatoes). Some birds became tame enough to follow people around, while others had their wings clipped to stop them flying away.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Breeding and life span</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Black-backed gulls generally breed in large colonies, anywhere from coastal sites to mountain lakes. They make nests of plant material, and lay one to five greyish-green eggs in October–November, which both sexes incubate. Chicks fly when they are 50 days old, and the birds breed from the age of four. They usually live for 14 years, but can live twice as long.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bird calls</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Gulls in New Zealand slang have a rough reputation. In the 1930s wharf labourers waiting for scraps of work were called seagulls. And in rugby, a seagull is a loose forward who scavenges for pickings on the edges of tight play</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Red-billed gulls</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The red-billed gull or tarāpunga (<i>Larus novaehollandiae</i>) has a white body with grey wings tipped with black then white. Their bills and legs are red. They are 37 centimetres long – considerably smaller than black-backed gulls. Males weigh 300 grams and females about 260 grams.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Red-billed gulls are found around the southern hemisphere in temperate and tropical regions. There are several subspecies, of which <i>Larus novaehollandiae scopulinus</i> occurs only in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The gulls are mainly coastal and offshore island birds, with the exception of a few at Lake Rotorua in the North Island. Here they nest alongside black-billed gulls, and occasionally interbreed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The country’s largest colonies are found on the coast near food sources of plankton, small fish and marine invertebrates. They also scavenge around city parks, freezing works, sewage pipelines and rubbish tips, and their numbers have grown since European settlement. The boom in numbers may be falling off, as sewage and offal are now treated rather than dumped at sea. In 1965 there were an estimated 40,000 breeding pairs.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Since the 1960s studies of red-billed gulls on Kaikōura Peninsula have documented their habits and social organisation. The colony is around 6,000 strong, although at least half the birds are non-breeders.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The gulls breed from October to December, laying one to five brownish eggs with purple blotches. Both sexes incubate the eggs, and the young fledge at 37 days. Once the breeding season is over, the colony disperses, and Kaikōura gulls have been seen as far afield as Auckland and Invercargill. Female gulls live around nine years and males about six, but some live up to 25 years.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Black-billed gulls</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Of New Zealand’s three species of gull, the black-billed gull (<i>Larus bulleri</i>) is the only endemic gull. Similar in size to red-billed gulls, their bills are black, and they are longer and finer in shape, with reddish-black legs and paler wings.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Black-billed gulls eat small fish, whitebait and flatfish, and take earthworms and grass grubs from pastureland. They feed on the wing, taking cicadas, moths and aquatic insects. In winter they fly to estuaries and harbours to eat marine invertebrates and shellfish, or to parks for worms and human handouts.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Black-billed gulls mainly breed inland, beside South Island rivers. In the late 20th century their breeding habitat became more varied, and some were living at Kaipara and Manukau harbours. They nest in colonies, and make nest mounds of dry grass and twigs on shingle. They lay one to four pale green-grey eggs from September to December, and parents share incubation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Chicks are left alone within a day of hatching, and parents return to feed them by regurgitating food onto the ground. Fledglings leave the nest when they are 26 days old. The birds live about 18 years.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Despite extending their range, black-billed gulls are declining in number. Populations have dropped along Canterbury and North Otago rivers, where hydroelectric schemes and irrigation have affected all bird species which nest there. Even in Southland, where 78% of the gulls nest, populations are falling. In 1974 there were 84,900 gulls breeding along the Oreti River; in 1997 there were 15,308. A New Zealand-wide count in 1996 found 48,000 nests.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Gulls of Mokoia</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In 1823 the Ngāpuhi tribe attacked the Te Arawa people living on Mokoia Island, in Lake Rotorua. Te Arawa only knew of the imminent attack when a flock of red- and black-billed gulls flew up, screaming a warning. The gulls circled overhead while Te Arawa were defeated. Following the battle, the Te Arawa priests honoured the birds by declaring them <i>tapu</i> (sacred).</p>

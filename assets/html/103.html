<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The tarakihi (<i>Nemadactylus macropterus</i>) is found throughout New Zealand. It feeds below 25 metres, scavenging worms, crabs, brittle stars and shellfish from the bottom. At night it rests on the sea floor, where its colouring becomes blotchy. This species also occurs in southern Australia where it is known as morwong.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Recreational anglers know the tarakihi well – when lifted from the water it often squeaks as air is expelled from its air bladder.</p>

<p class="p1">Tarakihi are members of a large family of Southern Hemisphere fishes that includes porae, assorted moki species and trumpeter. In Australia theses fishes are bunched together as ‘morwong’ with our tarakihi usually called ‘jackass morwong’.</p>
<p class="p1">There are at least two species of tarakihi in New Zealand. The smaller, common tarakihi (Nemadactylus macropterus) is distributed right around the country and as far south as the Auckland Islands. It is one of New Zealand’s most popular sport and table fish and supports a considerable commercial fishery. Average size is probably nearer one kilo than two, but specimens reach 4kg and heavier.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Another much larger and scientifically undescribed species, king tarakihi (Nemadactylus sp.), is caught in few widely spaced locations, including the Three Kings Islands, Kermadec Islands, East Cape and the Bay of Plenty. King tarakihi are generally found near offshore reefs adjacent to deep water where 3kg fish are common. They may weigh 5kg or more.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Tarakihi are schooling fish usually associated with areas of reef and other structure, though they also feed over sand and mud. They are most often caught in clear patches adjacent to foul and reef in water up to 100m-deep.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Food includes a wide range of crustaceans, invertebrates and occasionally small fishes. Tarakihi can be found close to the bottom, but often feed in mid-water, depending on the food source. Tarakihi schools are easily identified using your sounder.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Tarakihi reach maturity at between 25-35cm in length, so legal length fish (25cm in most areas) may or may not have had the chance to breed. Common tarakihi live to at least 20 years.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Spawning takes place in summer-autumn in several spawning areas. The Cape Runaway-East Cape, Kaikoura-Pegasus Bay and Jackson Bay are three known areas with others likely.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Juvenile tarakihi have a deepwater pelagic (free-swimming) phase before moving inshore to nursery areas when they are about a year old. These include the southwest coast of the North Island, Tasman Bay, Kaikoura, Pegasus Bay, Canterbury Bight, Otago and the Chatham Islands.</p>
<p class="p1">Juveniles move out into deeper water again at sexual maturity, when they’re around 25cm long. They may migrate long distances with fish tagged in Kaikoura recaptured as far away as Whangarei, Kaipara and Timaru.</p>

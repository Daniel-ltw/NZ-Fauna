<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Albatrosses are the world's largest seabirds. They normally breed on remote islands and spend at least 85 percent of their lives at sea, well away from land and human view. Renowned ocean wanderers, they travel vast distances from their breeding grounds to feed. The royal albatross, for example, with its massive wingspan of up to 3.3 metres flies an estimated 190,000 kilometres a year.</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Characteristics</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Albatrosses belong to the Procellariiformes, or petrels, a distinctive group of marine birds readily identified by their nostrils being sheathed in prominent horny tubes arising near the base of the bill. Other features of petrels are the hooked beak tip, long legs, webbed feet for swimming, and a thick coat of feathers with insulation usually augmented by a layer of fat below the skin. Like other seabirds they swallow salt water when feeding, so they have a salt gland behind each eye. This removes excess salt from their bloodstream. The salty solution then drains from the tubes along their bill.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Size and appearance</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Great size is the most obvious feature of albatrosses. The largest is the southern royal albatross, the male weighs 10.3 kilograms and has a wing span of up to 3.45 metres. The smallest is the yellow-nosed albatross, at about 2.1 kilograms and with a wing span of 1.9 metres. The long, narrow wings of albatrosses are highly developed for gliding, a mode of flight that enables them to cover vast distances with little energy expenditure. Most adults have a white body with dark upper wings and tail. However, adults of at least four species have mainly sooty or dark-brown plumage.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Number of species</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4">For a long time it was widely accepted that there were 13 species of albatross. More recently, up to 24 species have been suggested, although only 20 or 22 of these are likely to be agreed upon. They fit into four groups or genera:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">the great albatrosses (genus <i>Diomedea</i>). This includes the wandering and royal albatross groups, totalling six or seven species.</li>
  <li class="li4">small albatrosses, also known as mollymawks (genus <i>Thalassarche</i>). They are the grey-headed, black-browed, Campbell, Bullers, shy, Chatham, Salvins and yellow-nosed albatrosses. This makes a total of eight or nine species.</li>
  <li class="li4">two species of sooty albatrosses (genus <i>Phoebetria</i>). They are the sooty and light-mantled sooty albatrosses.</li>
  <li class="li4">the <i>Phoebastria</i> genus, which includes the Galapagos or waved albatross, two species of gooneys (laysan and black-footed albatrosses), and the Stellers or short-tailed albatross.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Where they roam</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4">The great albatrosses, mollymawks, and sooty albatrosses occur in the oceans of the southern hemisphere, although individual mollymawks sometimes stray into the North Atlantic, where they may be reported ashore in the same locality year after year. The Galapagos albatross breeds only on the Galapagos Islands and travels over a small area of ocean between these islands and the coasts of Ecuador and Peru. Laysan and black-footed albatrosses are both birds of the north Pacific Ocean, with most breeding on the Hawaiian islands during the northern winter. The short-tailed (or Stellers) albatross occurs in the north Pacific and breeds on islands off Japan.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>New Zealand’s albatrosses</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4">New Zealand has a particularly high diversity of albatrosses, with 11 of the world’s 22 species (and 13 out of 24 forms) of the great albatrosses, mollymawks and sooty albatrosses breeding there. Nine of these forms breed nowhere else. A number of others have been recorded as visitors or vagrants to the region.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Colonies</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Almost all New Zealand’s albatrosses breed on subantarctic islands and the Chatham group, but there is a small colony of just 20 pairs of Bullers albatrosses on the Three Kings Islands, north of the North Island. Most subantarctic islands support several species of albatross, for example, Campbell Island has six.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">The only mainland breeding colony is new. In 1914, northern royal albatrosses were noticed visiting Taiaroa Head on Otago Peninsula. The first egg was laid in 1920, but disturbance from predators and people meant that not until 1938 did a chick survive to fledge. This success was thanks to ornithologist Lance Richdale’s dedicated protection and campaigns. In 2005-06 there were 17 nests and more than 65 birds, and predator protection and visitor facilities now give the birds and the public a good experience. This is one of most accessible albatross colonies in the world for people to visit.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Food for Māori</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Toroa (albatross) eggs and chicks were an important food for Moriori living on the Chatham Islands. To reach colonies on wave-hammered rocky islets, they made wash-through rafts from bundles of lightweight reeds and inflated kelp bladders.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">On the mainland, albatross bones found in middens indicate that Māori ate the birds. The absence of chick bones indicates there were no mainland colonies at that time. Adult birds were caught while feeding at sea – then, as now, they were rarely found ashore on the mainland.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Albatross symbolism</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4">To Māori, albatrosses represented beauty and power. Wearing albatross feathers or bone pendants conferred these qualities on the wearer, usually a person of rank. Garlands of feathers sometimes adorned the prow of waka taua (war canoes). Albatrosses are depicted in cave drawings and in meeting houses.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Threats</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p6">Albatrosses spend most of their lives at sea, returning to land to breed and raise their young. The royal albatross, for example, starts breeding at around 10 years old, each pair raising raising one chick every two years. Their naturally low productivity, combined with changes in climate and habitat conditions and certain fishing practices, makes these seabirds vulnerable. The northern royal albatross, for example, has declined to such an extent that it is now listed as endangered.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Fisheries by-catch</b></p>
<p class="p6">Albatrosses feed by searching the sea surface for dead squid and fish. Many albatrosses have learnt that fishing vessels offer an easy food source and follow them, feeding on fish bait and scraps. Usually they take the bait without coming to any harm, but occasionally they get caught on a hook and are taken down with the line and drown.</p>
<p class="p6">While most fishing boats catch very small numbers of albatrosses, scientists are concerned that because many hundreds of fishing boats are setting lines around the world the total numbers caught may be having an impact on some populations.</p>
<p class="p6">Fishermen do not want to catch seabirds, and in New Zealand money collected as a levy from the fishing industry is being used to develop new ways of preventing them from getting caught. A new underwater setting device (a funnel) holds some promise as a solution.</p>
<p class="p6">An international commission set up under the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources is planning to publish a guidebook to albatrosses and petrels in several languages to help fishing crews correctly identify birds associated with their fishing operations.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Drift nets</b></p>
<p class="p6">Drift nets have taken a huge toll on seabirds. In 1990, it was estimated that a million seabirds were drowned in drift nets each year. A Convention prohibiting fishing with long drift nets in the South Pacific was signed in New Zealand in 1989 and entered into force in 1991, paving the way for the adoption in 1991 of a United Nations resolution calling for a global moratorium on long drift nets on the high seas.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Marine pollution</b></p>
<p class="p6">Oil spills and rubbish dumped at sea are hazards for seabirds. Thousands of seabirds die in the northern hemisphere each year from swallowing small pieces of plastic.</p>

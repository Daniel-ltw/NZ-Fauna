<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">New Zealand has three species of duck, the Paradise Shelduck, the Blue Duck or Whio and the Grey Duck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Paradise shelducks – pūtangitangi</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The white-headed female and black-headed male paradise shelduck (<i>Tadorna variegata</i>) make a striking pair. They generally mate for life, feeding and flying together. Their alternating calls form a haunting two-tone cry – the male a deep ‘honk’, the female a higher ‘heek’. The Māori name, pūtangitangi, refers to the call – tangi is a lamentation for the dead. The bird is also nicknamed parrie, short for paradise.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Shelducks are goose-like ducks with long necks. The endemic paradise shelduck is about 63 centimetres long; males weigh 1.7 kilograms and females 1.4 kilograms. They are partially protected, with regulated hunting permitted.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Habitat and feeding</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Paradise shelducks are found on open ground such as wide gravel riverbeds, tussock grassland or pasture, as well as around water. They sometimes frequent golf courses and city parks. Their foods include grass and clover, seeds and grain. They are one of the few native species to have benefited from the clearing of land for grazing and cropping. In wetlands they feed on aquatic vegetation, up-ending like dabbling ducks.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Breeding and life history</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Nests may be at ground level or up to 25 metres high in trees. About a day after hatching, too young to fly and just tiny balls of fluffy down, ducklings launch into space from the high nests, hitting the ground with a gentle thud. Both parents lead them at a fast clip to water, sometimes more than a kilometre away, where the ducklings feed on aquatic insects initially.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Juvenile males mostly form flocks and move away, but females remain near their parents. Adults generally stay close to their breeding territory, but flock to summer moulting sites.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The related chestnut-breasted shelduck (<i>Tadorna tadornoides</i>) was first recorded as a visitor in New Zealand in 1973, and has bred on a few occasions.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Changing fortunes</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Pūtangitangi were important food for Māori. The birds were caught during the moult, while plump and unable to fly, and then preserved in their own fat. Many were sent to Wellington and sold to European settlers. Settlers hunted paradise shelducks almost to extinction – they survived only in the south. Their numbers recovered with hunting controls and translocations, reaching 120,000 by 1981.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Whio – blue ducks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">New Zealand’s steep mountain streams and forested rivers are far too swift and rough for most ducks. However the whio (<i>Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos</i>) takes churning rapids, huge boulders and fallen logs in its stride. It has specialised features that are well adapted to this habitat.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Blue-grey with a flecked chestnut breast, the whio blends into its rock and water environment, often hiding in overhanging vegetation on the banks where it roosts and nests.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The whio has large, webbed feet to give it power in fast-flowing water, and well-developed claws for rough terrain. Even hatchlings have oversize feet and strong legs, ready to swim in swift currents and jump onto large rocks and logs.</p>
<p class="p1">The duck eats insect larvae – including caddisfly, mayfly and stonefly larvae – which it scrapes off rocks underwater. Its bony bill is protected from abrasion by a fleshy flap.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Whio are about 53 centimetres long. Males weigh 900 grams and females 750 grams.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Territory</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A whio pair’s territory is typically more than a kilometre of waterway, which the male defends with a high territorial whistle that carries beyond noisy rapids – hence its Māori name, which means whistle. The female has a grating alarm call.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Activity</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Whio often stay under cover in daylight, feeding at dawn and dusk. They occasionally fly low along their stretch of water by day. Juveniles seeking a new territory may make longer flights at night to a neighbouring valley or over a mountain pass.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>A clutch under the clutch</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Driving to Pūkaha Mt Bruce National Wildlife Centre with a clutch of two-week-old whio, wildlife officer Tom Steel was astounded when the strong-legged little ducklings leapt over from the rear seat and climbed onto his shoulder. Next thing they scrambled down and crawled under the clutch pedal.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Breeding</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Whio nest under cover on steep stream banks. Their ducklings are not brooded, but they reduce heat loss by huddling together. Adults guard them attentively as they learn to swim and feed in swift water.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Decline</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Māori did not find whio tasty, and the birds were still widespread and abundant in the early days of European settlement. But they lost ground as lowland forest was progressively cleared. Whio were still quite common in the 1950s, and their ongoing decline is mainly due to stoats. Introduced trout probably compete for food.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Conservation</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Whio are a protected endemic species. They are classified as nationally endangered, and the total population was estimated at 2,500 in 2004.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The Department of Conservation is working to stop their decline. Stoat control at several sites is allowing more ducklings to survive, and some have been raised in captivity to boost numbers in the wild. A population has also been re-established on Mt Taranaki (Mt Egmont).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Grey duck – pārera</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The grey duck or pārera (<i>Anas superciliosa</i>) is a large, finely proportioned duck with tapered dark eye-lines and contrasting pale eyebrows. It is 55 centimetres long. Males weigh around 1.1 kilograms and females 1 kilogram.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Distribution</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">Also known as the Pacific duck, the grey duck is native to New Zealand, Australia, New Guinea, Indonesia and the southern Pacific. The most numerous duck before Europeans settled in New Zealand, it was harvested by Māori after the end of the breeding season, following strict protocols.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Grey ducks were still the most common dabbling duck in New Zealand up to the 1950s, but as introduced mallards became established the two species have interbred. Numbers of grey ducks dropped from 1.5 million in 1970 to fewer than 500,000 in the 1990s. Loss of wetlands is another factor in their decline. They are partially protected, and are hunted in season.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Grey ducks are scattered all over New Zealand, including on the subantarctic, Chatham and Kermadec islands.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Habitat</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">Small lakes, slow streams or tidal waterways in forest are grey ducks’ preferred habitat. They have not taken to farmland or urban surroundings.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>A glutton for mud</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Māori sometimes called a greedy person ‘he pārera apu paru’, meaning ‘a pārera that gobbles mud’.</p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b><i>Feeding</i></b></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">Grey ducks feed by sieving seeds from the water through lamellae (short comb-like fringes) along the edges of their bill. They also eat aquatic vegetation, or graze above the shoreline. Ducklings eat aquatic invertebrates.</p>

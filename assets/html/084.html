<p class="p1"><b>General</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Skinks are smooth-skinned, sleek and shiny, with small legs. They have small eyes and can blink.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The diversity of skinks and genetic differences between species indicates that they must have been in New Zealand for many millions of years. Just how they got there and where they came from is still debated. Some researchers suggest that skinks arrived from New Caledonia more than 40 million years ago, when the sea level was lower and it may have been possible to island-hop south. Others think that skinks and geckos came to New Zealand during the last 20 million years. Further research is likely to clarify this.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Chevron skink</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The chevron skink is one of New Zealand's rarest lizards. It is listed as 'nationally vulnerable' under the Department of Conservation's Threat Classification System.</p>
<p class="p1">It is currently only known from Great and Little Barrier Islands in the Hauraki Gulf. Only around 500 sightings have been reported since it was first described in 1906. Most of these have been as a result of recent DOC surveys and monitoring but several have also been recorded by members of the public on Great Barrier Island.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>What's in a name?</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Chevron skink belongs to the genus <i>Oligosoma</i> (formerly <i>Leiolopisma</i>), members of which are only found in New Zealand. Its scientific name is <i>Oligosoma homalonotum</i>.</p>
<p class="p1">The species name <i>homalonotum</i> means smooth backed. Maori know the chevron skink as ‘Niho Taniwha’ meaning ‘teeth of the Taniwha’ in reference to the very distinctive v shaped markings on it’s back. These chevron like patterns also give the lizard its common name.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Some facts about chevron skinks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">They are New Zealand's longest lizard, capable of growing to over 30cm from the nose to the tip of the tail.</li>
  <li class="li1">Dark bands extend down the face of the chevron skink from below the eye to just under the lower lip. Between these two bands is a distinctive pale coloured "teardrop" shape. These patterns are unique to each chevron skink and can be used to identify individuals.</li>
  <li class="li1">Chevron skinks are capable of making noises and will often grunt or squeak on being disturbed.</li>
  <li class="li1">Female chevron skinks give birth to live young in mid to late summer, and can have up to 8 at once. It is not known if chevron skinks breed every year.</li>
  <li class="li1">Chevron skinks are good climbers and have been shown to climb trees during periods of heavy rain to avoid flooding in the streams and creeks in which they live.</li>
  <li class="li1">Most sightings of chevron skinks have been in close proximity to forested streams or other damp places especially in summer. This is thought to be due to their susceptibility to dehydration. Despite this, some adults have been known to turn up well away from streams over winter.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Lost for over 60 years</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">First scientifically described in 1906, the chevron skink was only reported twice more until the 1970s. It had essentially been "lost" from science for over 60 years. This was partly due to a mix up of museum labels that gave its locality as Flat Island in the Mokohinau Islands group. The label should have read Great Barrier Island.</p>
<p class="p1">Until the early 1990s the chevron skink was thought to survive only on Great Barrier Island. Then in 1991 a single sub-adult chevron skink was discovered on neighbouring Little Barrier Island. Despite intensive surveys since then, only one other chevron skink has been found on the island.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On Great Barrier they have now been recorded all over the island including up near the summit of Mt Hirakimata (over 600m a.s.l). Historical records suggest that they may also have occurred on the mainland in the past. </p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Cyclodina skink</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The <i>Cyclodina</i> group of lizards contains more rare species than any other group of New Zealand lizard. The group is also notable for containing the smallest indigenous skink - the copper skink (120mm) - and the largest - the 'presumed extinct' Northland skink (350mm).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Conservation status</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The species contained in the <i>Cyclodina</i> group are listed below.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Not threatened</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Copper skink</li>

<p class="p1"><b>Acutely threatened</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Whitaker's skink</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Extinct</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Northland skink</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Population and range</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">All species are confined to the North Island and islands immediately offshore. The geographic range of these species has greatly declined since the arrival of humans in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Grand and Otago skinks</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Grand and Otago skinks are two of New Zealand's most distinctive and impressive lizards. Known as giant skinks, they are our largest lizards, with Otago skinks growing up to 300mm in length and grand skinks 230mm.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Unlike many lizards overseas, both species are omnivorous, diurnal, and don't hibernate. They can live for up to 20 years in the wild, and like all lizards in this country, give birth to live young - two or three a year.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Both species are distinctively marked, which is why southern Māori know them as mokomoko. Grand skinks are black with yellowish flecks, and Otago skinks, black with grey, green, or yellowish blotches. These cryptic colour patterns provide great camouflage, amid the lichen-covered schist rocks they inhabit.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Distribution and range</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Both species are unique to Otago,and are two of New Zealand's rarest reptiles. They are now found in only eight per cent of their former range and have the highest possible threat status,'Nationally Critically Endangered'. Their original distribution was upland Otago from near the east coast to as far west as Lakes Hawea and Wanaka, and the Lindis Pass area to the north.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Until very recently it was feared that both grand and Otago skinks could be functionally extinct within a decade. That is that they would dwindle away to a point from which they could not return. Thanks to recent research breakthrough, it is thought that fate will not now be the case.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Ecology and habitat</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The two species share similar habitat, distribution, habits and diet; feeding on a wide variety of insects, fleshy fruits, and even smaller lizards.</p>
<p class="p1">habitat.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Today's populations are found in small occasional pockets within Otago. By far the strongest numbers are found in the Macraes area in the east, particularly in the DOC managed Macraes Conservation Area where important management research has been carried out.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Grand and Otago skinks live in very specific habitats - secure, sheltered crevices in large outcrops of schist, known as tors.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They're exceptionally well adapted to the cold upland, tussock and tor landscape they belong to. Even when there's snow on the ground and icicles on their rocks, if the sun is out, they'll bask on a rock ledge.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Survival</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Monitoring suggests there may be somewhere around 2000 of each species currently alive. There are no suitable of-shore island habitats within or outside their natural range to offer them security.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Ensuring that both species survive on mainland New Zealand is imperative. Achieving that is the main aim of DOC's Grand and Otago Skink Recovery Team, part of the Coastal Otago Area Office.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Striped skink</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Mysterious reptile</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The distinctively marked striped skink is one of New Zealand's least known and rarely seen lizards. The species is easily recognised by the pale stripes running down the length of its body, and makes for an eye-catching sight with its lightening quick movements.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The striped skink is listed as ‘Declining’ under the Department of Conservation's Threat Classification system.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The sparse records for this species indicate that they are widespread through the central North Island up to Great and Little Barrier Islands although their secretive nature has meant that accurate population monitoring has not yet been able to take place.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Ecology and habitat</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Striped skinks give birth in summer and can have up to eight young in a litter.</li>
  <li class="li1">Lifespan: Growth rates and lifespan are unknown, but an adult in captivity has lived for over 20 years.</li>
  <li class="li1">Diet: Their diet in the wild is largely unknown. In captivity they mainly eat insects, but will also eat soft fruit.</li>
  <li class="li1">Habitat: Striped skinks are found in mature lowland forest and pastoral farmland. The striped skink is a good climber and may spend most of its time in the canopy of mature forest. It is known to live beneath flaking bark and  crevasses in trunks, branches and epiphytes. They also dwell in logs and litter on the forest floor. On farmland they tend to live in rotting logs or rank vegetation. Striped skinks have also been found in swampland.</li>
  <li class="li1">Physiology: Striped skinks have been shown to have high rates of evaporative water loss making them susceptible to dehydration. This may account for their apparent tendency to inhabit damp areas.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Population and range</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Fewer than 150 striped skinks have ever been recorded from the wild and their actual population size is not known</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They are presently known from several widely scattered inland locations throughout the central and northern North Island and on Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands.</p>
